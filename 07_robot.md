{{index "project chapter", "reading code", "writing code"}}

In "project" chapters, I'll stop pummeling you with new theory for a
brief moment, and instead we'll work through a program together. Theory
is necessary to learn to program, but reading and understanding actual
programs is just as important.

Our project in this chapter is to build an ((automaton)), a little
program that performs a task in a ((virtual world)). Our automaton
will be a mail-delivery ((robot)) picking up and dropping off parcels.

## Meadowfield

{{index "roads array"}}

The village of ((Meadowfield)) isn't very big. It consists of 11
places with 14 roads between them. It can be described with this
array of roads:

```{includeCode: true}
const roads = [
  "Alice's House-Bob's House",   "Alice's House-Cabin",
  "Alice's House-Post Office",   "Bob's House-Town Hall",
  "Daria's House-Ernie's House", "Daria's House-Town Hall",
  "Ernie's House-Grete's House", "Grete's House-Farm",
  "Grete's House-Shop",          "Marketplace-Farm",
  "Marketplace-Post Office",     "Marketplace-Shop",
  "Marketplace-Town Hall",       "Shop-Town Hall"
];
```

{{figure {url: "img/village2x.png", alt: "The village of Meadowfield"}}}

The network of roads in the village forms a _((graph))_. A graph is a
collection of points (places in the village) with lines between them
(roads). This graph will be the world that our robot moves through.

{{index "roadGraph object"}}

The array of strings isn't very easy to work with. What we're
interested in is the destinations that we can reach from a given
place. Let's convert the list of roads to a data structure that, for
each place, tells us what can be reached from there.

```{includeCode: true}
function buildGraph(edges) {
  let graph = Object.create(null);
  function addEdge(from, to) {
    if (graph[from] == null) {
      graph[from] = [to];
    } else {
      graph[from].push(to);
    }
  }
  for (let [from, to] of edges.map(r => r.split("-"))) {
    addEdge(from, to);
    addEdge(to, from);
  }
  return graph;
}

const roadGraph = buildGraph(roads);
```

Given an array of edges, `buildGraph` creates a map object that, for
each node, stores an array of connected nodes.

{{index "split method"}}

It uses the `split` method to go from the road strings, which have the
form `"Start-End"`, to two-element arrays containing the start and end
as separate strings.

## The task

Our ((robot)) will be moving around the village. There are parcels
in various places, each addressed to some other place. The robot picks
up parcels when it comes to them and delivers them when it arrives at
their destinations.

The automaton must decide, at each point, where to go next. It has
finished its task when all parcels have been delivered.

{{index simulation, "virtual world"}}

To be able to simulate this process, we must define a virtual world
that can describe it. This model tells us where the robot is and where
the parcels are. When the robot has decided to move somewhere, we need
to update the model to reflect the new situation.

If you're thinking in terms of ((object-oriented programming)), your
first impulse might be to start defining objects for the various
elements in the world: a ((class)) for the robot, one for a parcel,
maybe one for places. These could then hold properties that describe
their current ((state)), such as the pile of parcels at a location,
which we could change when updating the world.

This is wrong.

At least, it usually is. The fact that something sounds like an object
does not automatically mean that it should be an object in your
program. Reflexively writing classes for every concept in your
application tends to leave you with a collection of interconnected
objects that each have their own internal, changing state. Such
programs are often hard to understand and thus easy to break.

Instead, let's condense the village's ((state)) down to the minimal
set of values that define it. There's the robot's current location and
the collection of undelivered parcels, each of which has a current
location and a destination address. That's it.

{{index "VillageState class", "persistent data structure"}}

And while we're at it, let's make it so that we don't _change_ this
state when the robot moves but rather compute a _new_ state for the
situation after the move.

```{includeCode: true}
class VillageState {
  constructor(place, parcels) {
    this.place = place;
    this.parcels = parcels;
  }

  move(destination) {
    if (!roadGraph[this.place].includes(destination)) {
      return this;
    } else {
      let parcels = this.parcels.map(p => {
        if (p.place != this.place) return p;
        return {place: destination, address: p.address};
      }).filter(p => p.place != p.address);
      return new VillageState(destination, parcels);
    }
  }
}
```

The `move` method is where the action happens. It first checks whether
there is a road going from the current place to the destination, and
if not, it returns the old state since this is not a valid move.

{{index "map method", "filter method"}}

Then it creates a new state with the destination as the robot's new
place. But it also needs to create a new set of parcels—parcels that
the robot is carrying (that are at the robot's current place) need to
be moved along to the new place. And parcels that are addressed to the
new place need to be delivered—that is, they need to be removed from
the set of undelivered parcels. The call to `map` takes care of the
moving, and the call to `filter` does the delivering.

Parcel objects aren't changed when they are moved but re-created. The
`move` method gives us a new village state but leaves the old one
entirely intact.

```
let first = new VillageState(
  "Post Office",
  [{place: "Post Office", address: "Alice's House"}]
);
let next = first.move("Alice's House");

console.log(next.place);
// → Alice's House
console.log(next.parcels);
// → []
console.log(first.place);
// → Post Office
```

The move causes the parcel to be delivered, and this is reflected in
the next state. But the initial state still describes the situation
where the robot is at the post office and the parcel is undelivered.

## Persistent data

{{index "persistent data structure", mutability, "data structure"}}

Data structures that don't change are called _((immutable))_ or
_persistent_. They behave a lot like strings and numbers in that they
are who they are and stay that way, rather than containing different
things at different times.

In JavaScript, just about everything _can_ be changed, so working with
values that are supposed to be persistent requires some restraint.
There is a function called `Object.freeze` that changes an object so
that writing to its properties is ignored. You could use that to make
sure your objects aren't changed, if you want to be careful. Freezing
does require the computer to do some extra work, and having updates
ignored is just about as likely to confuse someone as having them do
the wrong thing. So I usually prefer to just tell people that a given
object shouldn't be messed with and hope they remember it.

```
let object = Object.freeze({value: 5});
object.value = 10;
console.log(object.value);
// → 5
```

Why am I going out of my way to not change objects when the language
is obviously expecting me to?

Because it helps me understand my programs. This is about complexity
management again. When the objects in my system are fixed, stable
things, I can consider operations on them in isolation—moving to
Alice's house from a given start state always produces the same new
state. When objects change over time, that adds a whole new dimension
of complexity to this kind of reasoning.

For a small system like the one we are building in this chapter, we
could handle that bit of extra complexity. But the most important
limit on what kind of systems we can build is how much we can
understand. Anything that makes your code easier to understand makes
it possible to build a more ambitious system.

Unfortunately, although understanding a system built on persistent data
structures is easier, _designing_ one, especially when your
programming language isn't helping, can be a little harder. We'll
look for opportunities to use persistent data structures in this
book, but we'll also be using changeable ones.

## Simulation

{{index simulation, "virtual world"}}

A delivery ((robot)) looks at the world and decides in which
direction it wants to move. As such, we could say that a robot is a
function that takes a `VillageState` object and returns the name of a
nearby place.

{{index "runRobot function"}}

Because we want robots to be able to remember things, so that they can
make and execute plans, we also pass them their memory and allow them
to return a new memory. Thus, the thing a robot returns is an object
containing both the direction it wants to move in and a memory value
that will be given back to it the next time it is called.

```{includeCode: true}
function runRobot(state, robot, memory) {
  for (let turn = 0;; turn++) {
    if (state.parcels.length == 0) {
      console.log(`Done in ${turn} turns`);
      break;
    }
    let action = robot(state, memory);
    state = state.move(action.direction);
    memory = action.memory;
    console.log(`Moved to ${action.direction}`);
  }
}
```

Consider what a robot has to do to "solve" a given state. It must pick
up all parcels by visiting every location that has a parcel and
deliver them by visiting every location that a parcel is addressed to,
but only after picking up the parcel.

What is the dumbest strategy that could possibly work? The robot could
just walk in a random direction every turn. That means, with
great likelihood, it will eventually run into all parcels and then
also at some point reach the place where they should be delivered.

{{index "randomPick function", "randomRobot function"}}

Here's what that could look like:

```{includeCode: true}
function randomPick(array) {
  let choice = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);
  return array[choice];
}

function randomRobot(state) {
  return {direction: randomPick(roadGraph[state.place])};
}
```

{{index "Math.random function", "Math.floor function", array}}

Remember that `Math.random()` returns a number between zero and
one—but always below one. Multiplying such a number by the length of an
array and then applying `Math.floor` to it gives us a random index for
the array.

Since this robot does not need to remember anything, it ignores its
second argument (remember that JavaScript functions can be called with
extra arguments without ill effects) and omits the `memory` property
in its returned object.

To put this sophisticated robot to work, we'll first need a way to
create a new state with some parcels. A static method (written here by
directly adding a property to the constructor) is a good place to put
that functionality.

```{includeCode: true}
VillageState.random = function(parcelCount = 5) {
  let parcels = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < parcelCount; i++) {
    let address = randomPick(Object.keys(roadGraph));
    let place;
    do {
      place = randomPick(Object.keys(roadGraph));
    } while (place == address);
    parcels.push({place, address});
  }
  return new VillageState("Post Office", parcels);
};
```

{{index "do loop"}}

We don't want any parcels that are sent from the same place that they
are addressed to. For this reason, the `do` loop keeps picking new
places when it gets one that's equal to the address.

Let's start up a virtual world.

```{test: no}
runRobot(VillageState.random(), randomRobot);
// → Moved to Marketplace
// → Moved to Town Hall
// → …
// → Done in 63 turns
```

It takes the robot a lot of turns to deliver the parcels because it
isn't planning ahead very well. We'll address that soon.

{{if interactive

For a more pleasant perspective on the simulation, you can use the
`runRobotAnimation` function that's available in [this chapter's
programming environment](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#7).
This runs the simulation, but instead of outputting text, it shows
you the robot moving around the village map.

```{test: no}
runRobotAnimation(VillageState.random(), randomRobot);
```

The way `runRobotAnimation` is implemented will remain a mystery for
now, but after you've read the [later chapters](dom) of this book,
which discuss JavaScript integration in web browsers, you'll be able
to guess how it works.

if}}

## The mail truck's route

{{index "mailRoute array"}}

We should be able to do a lot better than the random ((robot)). An
easy improvement would be to take a hint from the way real-world mail
delivery works. If we find a route that passes all places in the
village, the robot could run that route twice, at which point it is
guaranteed to be done. Here is one such route (starting from the post
office):

```{includeCode: true}
const mailRoute = [
  "Alice's House", "Cabin", "Alice's House", "Bob's House",
  "Town Hall", "Daria's House", "Ernie's House",
  "Grete's House", "Shop", "Grete's House", "Farm",
  "Marketplace", "Post Office"
];
```

{{index "routeRobot function"}}

To implement the route-following robot, we'll need to make use of
robot memory. The robot keeps the rest of its route in its memory and
drops the first element every turn.

```{includeCode: true}
function routeRobot(state, memory) {
  if (memory.length == 0) {
    memory = mailRoute;
  }
  return {direction: memory[0], memory: memory.slice(1)};
}
```

This robot is a lot faster already. It'll take a maximum of 26 turns
(twice the 13-step route) but usually less.

{{if interactive

```{test: no}
runRobotAnimation(VillageState.random(), routeRobot, []);
```

if}}

## Pathfinding

Still, I wouldn't really call blindly following a fixed route
intelligent behavior. The ((robot)) could work more efficiently if it
adjusted its behavior to the actual work that needs to be done.

{{index pathfinding}}

To do that, it has to be able to deliberately move toward a given
parcel or toward the location where a parcel has to be delivered.
Doing that, even when the goal is more than one move away, will
require some kind of route-finding function.

The problem of finding a route through a ((graph)) is a typical
_((search problem))_. We can tell whether a given solution (a route)
is a valid solution, but we can't directly compute the solution the
way we could for 2 + 2. Instead, we have to keep creating potential
solutions until we find one that works.

The  number of possible routes through a graph is infinite. But
when searching for a route from _A_ to _B_, we are interested only in
the ones that start at _A_. We also don't care about routes that visit
the same place twice—those are definitely not the most efficient route
anywhere. So that cuts down on the number of routes that the route
finder has to consider.

In fact, we are mostly interested in the _shortest_ route. So we want
to make sure we look at short routes before we look at longer ones. A
good approach would be to "grow" routes from the starting point,
exploring every reachable place that hasn't been visited yet, until a
route reaches the goal. That way, we'll only explore routes that are
potentially interesting, and we'll find the shortest route (or one of the
shortest routes, if there are more than one) to the goal.

{{index "findRoute function"}}

{{id findRoute}}

Here is a function that does this:

```{includeCode: true}
function findRoute(graph, from, to) {
  let work = [{at: from, route: []}];
  for (let i = 0; i < work.length; i++) {
    let {at, route} = work[i];
    for (let place of graph[at]) {
      if (place == to) return route.concat(place);
      if (!work.some(w => w.at == place)) {
        work.push({at: place, route: route.concat(place)});
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The exploring has to be done in the right order—the places that were
reached first have to be explored first. We can't immediately explore
a place as soon as we reach it because that would mean places reached
_from there_ would also be explored immediately, and so on, even
though there may be other, shorter paths that haven't yet been
explored.

Therefore, the function keeps a _((work list))_. This is an array of
places that should be explored next, along with the route that got us
there. It starts with just the start position and an empty route.

The search then operates by taking the next item in the list and
exploring that, which means all roads going from that place are
looked at. If one of them is the goal, a finished route can be
returned. Otherwise, if we haven't looked at this place before, a new
item is added to the list. If we have looked at it before, since we
are looking at short routes first, we've found either a longer route
to that place or one precisely as long as the existing one, and we
don't need to explore it.

You can visually imagine this as a web of known routes crawling out
from the start location, growing evenly on all sides (but never
tangling back into itself). As soon as the first thread reaches the
goal location, that thread is traced back to the start, giving us our
route.

{{index "connected graph"}}

Our code doesn't handle the situation where there are no more work
items on the work list because we know that our graph is _connected_,
meaning that every location can be reached from all other locations.
We'll always be able to find a route between two points, and the
search can't fail.

```{includeCode: true}
function goalOrientedRobot({place, parcels}, route) {
  if (route.length == 0) {
    let parcel = parcels[0];
    if (parcel.place != place) {
      route = findRoute(roadGraph, place, parcel.place);
    } else {
      route = findRoute(roadGraph, place, parcel.address);
    }
  }
  return {direction: route[0], memory: route.slice(1)};
}
```

{{index "goalOrientedRobot function"}}

This robot uses its memory value as a list of directions to move in,
just like the route-following robot. Whenever that list is empty, it
has to figure out what to do next. It takes the first undelivered
parcel in the set and, if that parcel hasn't been picked up yet, plots a
route toward it. If the parcel _has_ been picked up, it still needs to be
delivered, so the robot creates a route toward the delivery address instead.

{{if interactive

Let's see how it does.

```{test: no, startCode: true}
runRobotAnimation(VillageState.random(),
                  goalOrientedRobot, []);
```

if}}

This robot usually finishes the task of delivering 5 parcels in about
16 turns. That's slightly better than `routeRobot` but still definitely not optimal.

## Exercises

### Measuring a robot

{{index "measuring a robot (exercise)", testing, automation, "compareRobots function"}}

It's hard to objectively compare ((robot))s by just letting them solve
a few scenarios. Maybe one robot just happened to get easier tasks or
the kind of tasks that it is good at, whereas the other didn't.

Write a function `compareRobots` that takes two robots (and their
starting memory). It should generate 100 tasks and let each of
the robots solve each of these tasks. When done, it should output the
average number of steps each robot took per task.

For the sake of fairness, make sure you give each task to both
robots, rather than generating different tasks per robot.

{{if interactive

```{test: no}
function compareRobots(robot1, memory1, robot2, memory2) {
  // Your code here
}

compareRobots(routeRobot, [], goalOrientedRobot, []);
```
if}}

{{hint

{{index "measuring a robot (exercise)", "runRobot function"}}

You'll have to write a variant of the `runRobot` function that,
instead of logging the events to the console, returns the number of
steps the robot took to complete the task.

Your measurement function can then, in a loop, generate new states and
count the steps each of the robots takes. When it has generated enough
measurements, it can use `console.log` to output the average for each
robot, which is the total number of steps taken divided by the number
of measurements.

hint}}

### Robot efficiency

{{index "robot efficiency (exercise)"}}

Can you write a robot that finishes the delivery task faster than
`goalOrientedRobot`? If you observe that robot's behavior, what
obviously stupid things does it do? How could those be improved?

If you solved the previous exercise, you might want to use your
`compareRobots` function to verify whether you improved the robot.

{{if interactive

```{test: no}
// Your code here

runRobotAnimation(VillageState.random(), yourRobot, memory);
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "robot efficiency (exercise)"}}

The main limitation of `goalOrientedRobot` is that it considers only
one parcel at a time. It will often walk back and forth across the
village because the parcel it happens to be looking at happens to be
at the other side of the map, even if there are others much closer.

One possible solution would be to compute routes for all packages and
then take the shortest one. Even better results can be obtained, if
there are multiple shortest routes, by preferring the ones that go to
pick up a package instead of delivering a package.

hint}}

### Persistent group

{{index "persistent group (exercise)", "persistent data structure", "Set class", "set (data structure)", "Group class", "PGroup class"}}

Most data structures provided in a standard JavaScript environment
aren't very well suited for persistent use. Arrays have `slice` and
`concat` methods, which allow us to easily create new arrays without
damaging the old one. But `Set`, for example, has no methods for
creating a new set with an item added or removed.

Write a new class `PGroup`, similar to the `Group` class from [Chapter
?](object#groups), which stores a set of values. Like `Group`, it has
`add`, `delete`, and `has` methods.

Its `add` method, however, should return a _new_ `PGroup` instance
with the given member added and leave the old one unchanged.
Similarly, `delete` creates a new instance without a given member.

The class should work for values of any type, not just strings. It
does _not_ have to be efficient when used with large amounts of
values.

The ((constructor)) shouldn't be part of the class's ((interface))
(though you'll definitely want to use it internally). Instead, there
is an empty instance, `PGroup.empty`, that can be used as a starting
value.

{{index singleton}}

Why do you need only one `PGroup.empty` value, rather than having a
function that creates a new, empty map every time?

{{if interactive

```{test: no}
class PGroup {
  // Your code here
}

let a = PGroup.empty.add("a");
let ab = a.add("b");
let b = ab.delete("a");

console.log(b.has("b"));
// → true
console.log(a.has("b"));
// → false
console.log(b.has("a"));
// → false
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "persistent map (exercise)", "Set class", array, "PGroup class"}}

The most convenient way to represent the set of member values
is still as an array since arrays are easy to copy.

{{index "concat method", "filter method"}}

When a value is added to the group, you can create a new group with a
copy of the original array that has the value added (for example, using
`concat`). When a value is deleted, you filter it from the array.

The class's ((constructor)) can take such an array as argument and
store it as the instance's (only) property. This array is never
updated.

{{index "static method"}}

To add a property (`empty`) to a constructor that is not a method, you
have to add it to the constructor after the class definition, as a
regular property.

You need only one `empty` instance because all empty groups are the
same and instances of the class don't change. You can create many
different groups from that single empty group without affecting it.

hint}}
