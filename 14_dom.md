# The Document Object Model

{{quote {author: "Friedrich Nietzsche", title: "Beyond Good and Evil", chapter: true}

Too bad! Same old story! Once you've finished building your house you
notice you've accidentally learned something that you really should
have known—before you started.

{{index drawing, parsing}}

When you open a web page in your browser, the browser retrieves the
page's ((HTML)) text and parses it, much like the way our parser from
[Chapter ?](language#parsing) parsed programs. The browser builds up a
model of the document's ((structure)) and uses this model to draw the
page on the screen.

{{index "live data structure"}}

This representation of the ((document)) is one of the toys that a
JavaScript program has available in its ((sandbox)). It is a ((data
structure)) that you can read or modify. It acts as a _live_ data
structure: when it's modified, the page on the screen is updated to
reflect the changes.

## Document structure

You can imagine an ((HTML)) document as a nested set of ((box))es.
Tags such as `<body>` and `</body>` enclose other ((tag))s, which in
turn contain other tags or ((text)). Here's the example document from
the [previous chapter](browser):

```{lang: "text/html", sandbox: "homepage"}
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My home page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My home page</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am Marijn and this is my home page.</p>
    <p>I also wrote a book! Read it
      <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net">here</a>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This page has the following structure:

{{figure {url: "img/html-boxes.svg", alt: "HTML document as nested boxes", width: "7cm"}}}

{{indexsee "Document Object Model", DOM}}

The data structure the browser uses to represent the document follows
this shape. For each box, there is an ((object)), which we can
interact with to find out things such as what HTML tag it represents
and which boxes and text it contains. This representation is called
the _Document Object Model_, or ((DOM)) for short.

{{index "documentElement property", "head property", "body property", "html (HTML tag)", "body (HTML tag)", "head (HTML tag)"}}

The global binding `document` gives us access to these objects. Its
`documentElement` property refers to the object representing the
`<html>` tag. Since every HTML document has a head and a body, it also
has `head` and `body` properties, pointing at those elements.

## Trees

{{index [nesting, "of objects"]}}

Think back to the ((syntax tree))s from [Chapter ?](language#parsing)
for a moment. Their structures are strikingly similar to the structure
of a browser's document. Each _((node))_ may refer to other nodes,
_children_, which in turn may have their own children. This shape is
typical of nested structures where elements can contain subelements
that are similar to themselves.

{{index "documentElement property"}}

We call a data structure a _((tree))_ when it has a branching
structure, has no ((cycle))s (a node may not contain itself, directly
or indirectly), and has a single, well-defined _((root))_. In the case
of the ((DOM)), `document.documentElement` serves as the root.

{{index sorting, "data structure", "syntax tree"}}

Trees come up a lot in computer science. In addition to representing
recursive structures such as HTML documents or programs, they are
often used to maintain sorted ((set))s of data because elements can
usually be found or inserted more efficiently in a tree than in a flat
array.

{{index "leaf node", "Egg language"}}

A typical tree has different kinds of ((node))s. The syntax tree for
[the Egg language](language) had identifiers, values, and application
nodes. Application nodes may have children, whereas identifiers and
values are _leaves_, or nodes without children.

{{index "body property"}}

The same goes for the DOM. Nodes for _((element))s_, which represent
((HTML)) tags, determine the structure of the document. These can have
((child node))s. An example of such a node is `document.body`. Some of
these children can be ((leaf node))s, such as pieces of ((text)) or
((comment)) nodes.

{{index "text node", element, "ELEMENT_NODE code", "COMMENT_NODE code", "TEXT_NODE code", "nodeType property"}}

Each DOM node object has a `nodeType` property, which contains a code
(number) that identifies the type of node. Elements have code 1, which
is also defined as the constant property `Node.ELEMENT_NODE`. Text
nodes, representing a section of text in the document, get code 3
(`Node.TEXT_NODE`). Comments have code 8
(`Node.COMMENT_NODE`).

Another way to visualize our document ((tree)) is as follows:

{{figure {url: "img/html-tree.svg", alt: "HTML document as a tree",width: "8cm"}}}

The leaves are text nodes, and the arrows indicate parent-child
relationships between nodes.

{{id standard}}

## The standard

{{index "programming language", [interface, design]}}

Using cryptic numeric codes to represent node types is not a very
JavaScript-like thing to do. Later in this chapter, we'll see that
other parts of the ((DOM)) interface also feel cumbersome and alien.
The reason for this is that the DOM wasn't designed for just
JavaScript. Rather, it tries to be a language-neutral ((interface))
that can be used in other systems as well—not just for HTML but also
for ((XML)), which is a generic ((data format)) with an HTML-like
syntax.

{{index consistency, integration}}

This is unfortunate. Standards are often useful. But in this case, the
advantage (cross-language consistency) isn't all that compelling.
Having an interface that is properly integrated with the language you
are using will save you more time than having a familiar interface
across languages.

{{index "array-like object", "NodeList type"}}

As an example of this poor integration, consider the `childNodes`
property that element nodes in the DOM have. This property holds an
array-like object, with a `length` property and properties labeled by
numbers to access the child nodes. But it is an instance of the
`NodeList` type, not a real array, so it does not have methods such as
`slice` and `map`.

{{index [interface, design], [DOM, construction], "side effect"}}

Then there are issues that are simply poor design. For example, there
is no way to create a new node and immediately add children or
((attribute))s to it. Instead, you have to first create it and then add
the children and attributes one by one, using side effects. Code that
interacts heavily with the DOM tends to get long, repetitive, and
ugly.

{{index library}}

But these flaws aren't fatal. Since JavaScript allows us to create our
own ((abstraction))s, it is possible to design improved ways to
express the operations you are performing. Many libraries intended for
browser programming come with such tools.

## Moving through the tree

{{index pointer}}

DOM nodes contain a wealth of ((link))s to other nearby nodes. The
following diagram illustrates these:

{{figure {url: "img/html-links.svg", alt: "Links between DOM nodes",width: "6cm"}}}

{{index "child node", "parentNode property", "childNodes property"}}

Although the diagram shows only one link of each type, every node has
a `parentNode` property that points to the node it is part of, if any.
Likewise, every element node (node type 1) has a `childNodes` property
that points to an ((array-like object)) holding its children.

{{index "firstChild property", "lastChild property", "previousSibling property", "nextSibling property"}}

In theory, you could move anywhere in the tree using just these parent
and child links. But JavaScript also gives you access to a number of
additional convenience links. The `firstChild` and `lastChild`
properties point to the first and last child elements or have the
value `null` for nodes without children. Similarly, `previousSibling`
and `nextSibling` point to adjacent nodes, which are nodes with the
same parent that appear immediately before or after the node itself.
For a first child, `previousSibling` will be null, and for a last
child, `nextSibling` will be null.

{{index "children property", "text node", element}}

There's also the `children` property, which is like `childNodes` but
contains only element (type 1) children, not other types of
child nodes. This can be useful when you aren't interested in text
nodes.

{{index "talksAbout function", recursion, [nesting, "of objects"]}}

When dealing with a nested data structure like this one, recursive
functions are often useful. The following function scans a document
for ((text node))s containing a given string and returns `true` when
it has found one:

{{id talksAbout}}

```{sandbox: "homepage"}
function talksAbout(node, string) {
  if (node.nodeType == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {
    for (let i = 0; i < node.childNodes.length; i++) {
      if (talksAbout(node.childNodes[i], string)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  } else if (node.nodeType == Node.TEXT_NODE) {
    return node.nodeValue.indexOf(string) > -1;
  }
}

console.log(talksAbout(document.body, "book"));
// → true
```

{{index "childNodes property", "array-like object", "Array.from function"}}

Because `childNodes` is not a real array, we cannot loop over it with
`for`/`of` and have to run over the index range using a regular `for`
loop or use `Array.from`.

{{index "nodeValue property"}}

The `nodeValue` property of a text node holds the string of text that
it represents.

## Finding elements

{{index DOM, "body property", "hard-coding"}}

Navigating these ((link))s among parents, children, and siblings is
often useful. But if we want to find a specific node in the document,
reaching it by starting at `document.body` and following a fixed path
of properties is a bad idea. Doing so bakes assumptions into our
program about the precise structure of the document—a structure you
might want to change later. Another complicating factor is that text
nodes are created even for the ((whitespace)) between nodes. The
example document's `<body>` tag does not have just three children (`<h1>`
and two `<p>` elements) but actually has seven: those three, plus the
spaces before, after, and between them.

{{index searching, "href attribute", "getElementsByTagName method"}}

So if we want to get the `href` attribute of the link in that
document, we don't want to say something like "Get the second child of
the sixth child of the document body". It'd be better if we could say
"Get the first link in the document". And we can.

```{sandbox: "homepage"}
let link = document.body.getElementsByTagName("a")[0];
console.log(link.href);
```

{{index "child node"}}

All element nodes have a `getElementsByTagName` method, which collects
all elements with the given tag name that are descendants (direct or
indirect children) of that node and returns them as an ((array-like
object)).

{{index "id attribute", "getElementById method"}}

To find a specific _single_ node, you can give it an `id` attribute
and use `document.getElementById` instead.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<p>My ostrich Gertrude:</p>
<p><img id="gertrude" src="img/ostrich.png"></p>

<script>
  let ostrich = document.getElementById("gertrude");
  console.log(ostrich.src);
</script>
```

{{index "getElementsByClassName method", "class attribute"}}

A third, similar method is `getElementsByClassName`, which, like
`getElementsByTagName`, searches through the contents of an element
node and retrieves all elements that have the given string in their
`class` attribute.

## Changing the document

{{index "side effect", "removeChild method", "appendChild method", "insertBefore method", [DOM, construction]}}

Almost everything about the ((DOM)) data structure can be changed. The
shape of the document tree can be modified by changing parent-child
relationships. Nodes have a `remove` method to remove them from their
current parent node. To add a child node to an element node, we can
use `appendChild`, which puts it at the end of the list of children,
or `insertBefore`, which inserts the node given as the first argument
before the node given as the second argument.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<p>One</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Three</p>

<script>
  let paragraphs = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");
  document.body.insertBefore(paragraphs[2], paragraphs[0]);
</script>
```

A node can exist in the document in only one place. Thus, inserting
paragraph _Three_ in front of paragraph _One_ will first remove it
from the end of the document and then insert it at the front,
resulting in _Three_/_One_/_Two_. All operations that insert a node
somewhere will, as a ((side effect)), cause it to be removed from its
current position (if it has one).

{{index "insertBefore method", "replaceChild method"}}

The `replaceChild` method is used to replace a child node with another
one. It takes as arguments two nodes: a new node and the node to be
replaced. The replaced node must be a child of the element the method
is called on. Note that both `replaceChild` and `insertBefore` expect
the _new_ node as their first argument.

## Creating nodes

{{index "alt attribute", "img (HTML tag)"}}

Say we want to write a script that replaces all ((image))s (`<img>`
tags) in the document with the text held in their `alt` attributes,
which specifies an alternative textual representation of the image.

{{index "createTextNode method"}}

This involves not only removing the images but adding a new text node
to replace them. Text nodes are created with the
`document.createTextNode` method.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<p>The <img src="img/cat.png" alt="Cat"> in the
  <img src="img/hat.png" alt="Hat">.</p>

<p><button onclick="replaceImages()">Replace</button></p>

<script>
  function replaceImages() {
    let images = document.body.getElementsByTagName("img");
    for (let i = images.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      let image = images[i];
      if (image.alt) {
        let text = document.createTextNode(image.alt);
        image.parentNode.replaceChild(text, image);
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

{{index "text node"}}

Given a string, `createTextNode` gives us a text node that we can
insert into the document to make it show up on the screen.

{{index "live data structure", "getElementsByTagName method", "childNodes property"}}

The loop that goes over the images starts at the end of the list. This
is necessary because the node list returned by a method like
`getElementsByTagName` (or a property like `childNodes`) is _live_.
That is, it is updated as the document changes. If we started from the
front, removing the first image would cause the list to lose its first
element so that the second time the loop repeats, where `i` is 1, it
would stop because the length of the collection is now also 1.

{{index "slice method"}}

If you want a _solid_ collection of nodes, as opposed to a live one,
you can convert the collection to a real array by calling
`Array.from`.

```
let arrayish = {0: "one", 1: "two", length: 2};
let array = Array.from(arrayish);
console.log(array.map(s => s.toUpperCase()));
// → ["ONE", "TWO"]
```

{{index "createElement method"}}

To create ((element)) nodes, you can use the `document.createElement`
method. This method takes a tag name and returns a new empty node of
the given type.

{{index "Popper, Karl", [DOM, construction], "elt function"}}

{{id elt}}

The following example defines a utility `elt`, which creates an
element node and treats the rest of its arguments as children to that
node. This function is then used to add an attribution to a quote.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<blockquote id="quote">
  No book can ever be finished. While working on it we learn
  just enough to find it immature the moment we turn away
  from it.
</blockquote>

<script>
  function elt(type, ...children) {
    let node = document.createElement(type);
    for (let child of children) {
      if (typeof child != "string") node.appendChild(child);
      else node.appendChild(document.createTextNode(child));
    }
    return node;
  }

  document.getElementById("quote").appendChild(
    elt("footer", "—",
        elt("strong", "Karl Popper"),
        ", preface to the second editon of ",
        elt("em", "The Open Society and Its Enemies"),
        ", 1950"));
</script>
```

{{if book

This is what the resulting document looks like:

{{figure {url: "img/blockquote.png", alt: "A blockquote with attribution",width: "8cm"}}}

if}}

## Attributes

{{index "href attribute"}}

Some element ((attribute))s, such as `href` for links, can be accessed
through a ((property)) of the same name on the element's ((DOM))
object. This is the case for most commonly used standard attributes.

{{index "data attribute", "getAttribute method", "setAttribute method", attribute}}

But HTML allows you to set any attribute you want on nodes. This can
be useful because it allows you to store extra information in a
document. If you make up your own attribute names, though, such
attributes will not be present as properties on the element's node.
Instead, you have to use the `getAttribute` and `setAttribute` methods
to work with them.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<p data-classified="secret">The launch code is 00000000.</p>
<p data-classified="unclassified">I have two feet.</p>

<script>
  let paras = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p");
  for (let para of Array.from(paras)) {
    if (para.getAttribute("data-classified") == "secret") {
      para.remove();
    }
  }
</script>
```

It is recommended to prefix the names of such made-up attributes with
`data-` to ensure they do not conflict with any other attributes.

{{index "getAttribute method", "setAttribute method", "className property", "class attribute"}}

There is a commonly used attribute, `class`, which is a ((keyword)) in
the JavaScript language. For historical reasons—some old JavaScript
implementations could not handle property names that matched
keywords—the property used to access this attribute is called
`className`. You can also access it under its real name, `"class"`, by
using the `getAttribute` and `setAttribute` methods.

## Layout

{{index layout, "block element", "inline element", "p (HTML tag)", "h1 (HTML tag)", "a (HTML tag)", "strong (HTML tag)"}}

You may have noticed that different types of elements are laid out
differently. Some, such as paragraphs (`<p>`) or headings (`<h1>`),
take up the whole width of the document and are rendered on separate
lines. These are called _block_ elements. Others, such as links
(`<a>`) or the `<strong>` element, are rendered on the same line with
their surrounding text. Such elements are called _inline_ elements.

{{index drawing}}

For any given document, browsers are able to compute a layout, which
gives each element a size and position based on its type and content.
This layout is then used to actually draw the document.

{{index "border (CSS)", "offsetWidth property", "offsetHeight property", "clientWidth property", "clientHeight property", dimensions}}

The size and position of an element can be accessed from JavaScript.
The `offsetWidth` and `offsetHeight` properties give you the space the
element takes up in _((pixel))s_. A pixel is the basic unit of
measurement in the browser. It traditionally corresponds to the
smallest dot that the screen can draw, but on modern displays, which
can draw _very_ small dots, that may no longer be the case, and a
browser pixel may span multiple display dots.

Similarly, `clientWidth` and `clientHeight` give you the size of the
space _inside_ the element, ignoring border width.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<p style="border: 3px solid red">
  I'm boxed in
</p>

<script>
  let para = document.body.getElementsByTagName("p")[0];
  console.log("clientHeight:", para.clientHeight);
  console.log("offsetHeight:", para.offsetHeight);
</script>
```

{{if book

Giving a paragraph a border causes a rectangle to be drawn around it.

{{figure {url: "img/boxed-in.png", alt: "A paragraph with a border",width: "8cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "getBoundingClientRect method", position, "pageXOffset property", "pageYOffset property"}}

{{id boundingRect}}

The most effective way to find the precise position of an element on
the screen is the `getBoundingClientRect` method. It returns an object
with `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties, indicating the
pixel positions of the sides of the element relative to the top left
of the screen. If you want them relative to the whole document, you
must add the current scroll position, which you can find in the
`pageXOffset` and `pageYOffset` bindings.

{{index "offsetHeight property", "getBoundingClientRect method", drawing, laziness, performance, efficiency}}

Laying out a document can be quite a lot of work. In the interest of
speed, browser engines do not immediately re-layout a document every
time you change it but wait as long as they can. When a JavaScript
program that changed the document finishes running, the browser will
have to compute a new layout to draw the changed document to
the screen. When a program _asks_ for the position or size of
something by reading properties such as `offsetHeight` or calling
`getBoundingClientRect`, providing correct information also requires
computing a ((layout)).

{{index "side effect", optimization, benchmark}}

A program that repeatedly alternates between reading DOM layout
information and changing the DOM forces a lot of layout computations
to happen and will consequently run very slowly. The following code is
an example of this. It contains two different programs that build up a
line of _X_ characters 2,000 pixels wide and measures the time each
one takes.

```{lang: "text/html", test: nonumbers}
<p><span id="one"></span></p>
<p><span id="two"></span></p>

<script>
  function time(name, action) {
    let start = Date.now(); // Current time in milliseconds
    action();
    console.log(name, "took", Date.now() - start, "ms");
  }

  time("naive", () => {
    let target = document.getElementById("one");
    while (target.offsetWidth < 2000) {
      target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("X"));
    }
  });
  // → naive took 32 ms

  time("clever", function() {
    let target = document.getElementById("two");
    target.appendChild(document.createTextNode("XXXXX"));
    let total = Math.ceil(2000 / (target.offsetWidth / 5));
    target.firstChild.nodeValue = "X".repeat(total);
  });
  // → clever took 1 ms
</script>
```

## Styling

{{index "block element", "inline element", style, "strong (HTML tag)", "a (HTML tag)", underline}}

We have seen that different HTML elements are drawn differently. Some
are displayed as blocks, others inline. Some add styling—`<strong>`
makes its content ((bold)), and `<a>` makes it blue and underlines it.

{{index "img (HTML tag)", "default behavior", "style attribute"}}

The way an `<img>` tag shows an image or an `<a>` tag causes a link to
be followed when it is clicked is strongly tied to the element type.
But we can change the styling associated with an element, such
as the text color or underline. Here is an example that uses
the `style` property:

```{lang: "text/html"}
<p><a href=".">Normal link</a></p>
<p><a href="." style="color: green">Green link</a></p>
```

{{if book

The second link will be green instead of the default link color.

{{figure {url: "img/colored-links.png", alt: "A normal and a green link",width: "2.2cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "border (CSS)", "color (CSS)", CSS, "colon character"}}

A style attribute may contain one or more _((declaration))s_, which
are a property (such as `color`) followed by a colon and a value (such
as `green`). When there is more than one declaration, they must be
separated by ((semicolon))s, as in `"color: red; border: none"`.

{{index "display (CSS)", layout}}

A lot of aspects of the document can be influenced by
styling. For example, the `display` property controls whether an
element is displayed as a block or an inline element.

```{lang: "text/html"}
This text is displayed <strong>inline</strong>,
<strong style="display: block">as a block</strong>, and
<strong style="display: none">not at all</strong>.
```

{{index "hidden element"}}

The `block` tag will end up on its own line since ((block element))s
are not displayed inline with the text around them. The last tag is
not displayed at all—`display: none` prevents an element from showing
up on the screen. This is a way to hide elements. It is often
preferable to removing them from the document entirely because it
makes it easy to reveal them again later.

{{if book

{{figure {url: "img/display.png", alt: "Different display styles",width: "4cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "color (CSS)", "style attribute"}}

JavaScript code can directly manipulate the style of an element
through the element's `style` property. This property holds an object
that has properties for all possible style properties. The values of
these properties are strings, which we can write to in order to change
a particular aspect of the element's style.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<p id="para" style="color: purple">
  Nice text
</p>

<script>
  let para = document.getElementById("para");
  console.log(para.style.color);
  para.style.color = "magenta";
</script>
```

{{index "camel case", capitalization, "hyphen character", "font-family (CSS)"}}

Some style property names contain hyphens, such as `font-family`.
Because such property names are awkward to work with in JavaScript
(you'd have to say `style["font-family"]`), the property names in the
`style` object for such properties have their hyphens removed and the
letters after them capitalized (`style.fontFamily`).

## Cascading styles

{{index "rule (CSS)", "style (HTML tag)"}}

{{indexsee "Cascading Style Sheets", CSS}}

The styling system for HTML is called ((CSS)), for _Cascading Style
Sheets_. A _((style sheet))_ is a set of rules for how to style
elements in a document. It can be given inside a `<style>` tag.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<style>
  strong {
    font-style: italic;
    color: gray;
  }
</style>
<p>Now <strong>strong text</strong> is italic and gray.</p>
```

{{index "rule (CSS)", "font-weight (CSS)", overlay}}

The _((cascading))_ in the name refers to the fact that multiple such
rules are combined to produce the final style for an element. In the
example, the default styling for `<strong>` tags, which gives them
`font-weight: bold`, is overlaid by the rule in the `<style>` tag,
which adds `font-style` and `color`.

{{index "style (HTML tag)", "style attribute"}}

When multiple rules define a value for the same property, the most
recently read rule gets a higher ((precedence)) and wins. So if the
rule in the `<style>` tag included `font-weight: normal`,
contradicting the default `font-weight` rule, the text would be
normal, _not_ bold. Styles in a `style` attribute applied directly to
the node have the highest precedence and always win.

{{index uniqueness, "class attribute", "id attribute"}}

It is possible to target things other than ((tag)) names in CSS rules.
A rule for `.abc` applies to all elements with `"abc"` in their `class`
attribute. A rule for `#xyz` applies to the element with an `id`
attribute of `"xyz"` (which should be unique within the document).

```{lang: "text/css"}
.subtle {
  color: gray;
  font-size: 80%;
}
#header {
  background: blue;
  color: white;
}
/* p elements with id main and with classes a and b */
p#main.a.b {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

{{index "rule (CSS)"}}

The ((precedence)) rule favoring the most recently defined rule
applies only when the rules have the same _((specificity))_. A rule's
specificity is a measure of how precisely it describes matching
elements, determined by the number and kind (tag, class, or ID) of
element aspects it requires. For example, a rule that targets `p.a` is
more specific than rules that target `p` or just `.a` and would thus
take precedence over them.

{{index "direct child node"}}

The notation `p > a {…}` applies the given styles to all `<a>` tags
that are direct children of `<p>` tags. Similarly, `p a {…}` applies
to all `<a>` tags inside `<p>` tags, whether they are direct or
indirect children.

## Query selectors

{{index complexity}}

We won't be using ((style sheet))s all that much in this book.
Understanding them is helpful when programming in the browser, but
they are complicated enough to warrant a separate book.

{{index "domain-specific language"}}

The main reason I introduced _((selector))_ syntax—the notation used
in style sheets to determine which elements a set of styles apply
to—is that we can use this same mini-language as an effective way to
find ((DOM)) elements.

{{index "querySelectorAll method", "NodeList type"}}

The `querySelectorAll` method, which is defined both on the `document`
object and on element nodes, takes a selector string and returns a
`NodeList` containing all the elements that it matches.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<p>And if you go chasing
  <span class="animal">rabbits</span></p>

{{index "live data structure"}}

Unlike methods such as `getElementsByTagName`, the object returned by
`querySelectorAll` is _not_ live. It won't change when you change the
document. It is still not a real array, though, so you still need to
call `Array.from` if you want to treat it like one.

{{index "querySelector method"}}

The `querySelector` method (without the `All` part) works in a similar
way. This one is useful if you want a specific, single element. It
will return only the first matching element or null when no element
matches.

{{id animation}}

## Positioning and animating

{{index "position (CSS)", "relative positioning", "top (CSS)", "left (CSS)", "absolute positioning"}}

The `position` style property influences layout in a powerful way. By
default it has a value of `static`, meaning the element sits in its
normal place in the document. When it is set to `relative`, the
element still takes up space in the document, but now the `top` and
`left` style properties can be used to move it relative to that normal
place. When `position` is set to `absolute`, the element is removed
from the normal document flow—that is, it no longer takes up space and
may overlap with other elements. Also, its `top` and `left` properties
can be used to absolutely position it relative to the top-left corner
of the nearest enclosing element whose `position` property isn't
`static`, or relative to the document if no such enclosing element
exists.

We can use this to create an ((animation)). The following document
displays a picture of a cat that moves around in an ((ellipse)):

```{lang: "text/html", startCode: true}
<p style="text-align: center">
  <img src="img/cat.png" style="position: relative">
</p>
<script>
  let cat = document.querySelector("img");
  let angle = Math.PI / 2;
  function animate(time, lastTime) {
    if (lastTime != null) {
      angle += (time - lastTime) * 0.001;
    }
    cat.style.top = (Math.sin(angle) * 20) + "px";
    cat.style.left = (Math.cos(angle) * 200) + "px";
    requestAnimationFrame(newTime => animate(newTime, time));
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
</script>
```

{{if book

The gray arrow shows the path along which the image moves.

{{figure {url: "img/cat-animation.png", alt: "A moving cat head",width: "8cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "top (CSS)", "left (CSS)", centering, "relative positioning"}}

Our picture is centered on the page and given a `position` of
`relative`. We'll repeatedly update that picture's `top` and `left`
styles to move it.

{{index "requestAnimationFrame function", drawing, animation}}

{{id animationFrame}}

The script uses `requestAnimationFrame` to schedule the `animate`
function to run whenever the browser is ready to repaint the screen.
The `animate` function itself again calls `requestAnimationFrame` to
schedule the next update. When the browser window (or tab) is active,
this will cause updates to happen at a rate of about 60 per second,
which tends to produce a good-looking animation.

{{index timeline, blocking}}

If we just updated the DOM in a loop, the page would freeze, and
nothing would show up on the screen. Browsers do not update their
display while a JavaScript program is running, nor do they allow any
interaction with the page. This is why we need
`requestAnimationFrame`—it lets the browser know that we are done for
now, and it can go ahead and do the things that browsers do, such as
updating the screen and responding to user actions.

{{index "smooth animation"}}

The ((animation)) function is passed the current ((time)) as an
argument. To ensure that the motion of the cat per millisecond is
stable, it bases the speed at which the angle changes on the
difference between the current time and the last time the function
ran. If it just moved the angle by a fixed amount per step, the motion
would stutter if, for example, another heavy task running on the same
computer were to prevent the function from running for a fraction of a
second.

{{index "Math.cos function", "Math.sin function", cosine, sine, trigonometry}}

{{id sin_cos}}

Moving in ((circle))s is done using the trigonometry functions
`Math.cos` and `Math.sin`. For those who aren't familiar with
these, I'll briefly introduce them since we will occasionally use them
in this book.

{{index coordinates, pi}}

`Math.cos` and `Math.sin` are useful for finding points that lie on a
circle around point (0,0) with a radius of one. Both functions
interpret their argument as the position on this circle, with zero
denoting the point on the far right of the circle, going clockwise
until 2π (about 6.28) has taken us around the whole circle. `Math.cos`
tells you the x-coordinate of the point that corresponds to the given
position, and `Math.sin` yields the y-coordinate. Positions (or
angles) greater than 2π or less than 0 are valid—the rotation repeats
so that _a_+2π refers to the same ((angle)) as _a_.

{{index "PI constant"}}

This unit for measuring angles is called ((radian))s—a full circle is
2π radians, similar to how it is 360 degrees when measuring in
degrees. The constant π is available as `Math.PI` in JavaScript.

{{figure {url: "img/cos_sin.svg", alt: "Using cosine and sine to compute coordinates",width: "6cm"}}}

{{index "counter variable", "Math.sin function", "top (CSS)", "Math.cos function", "left (CSS)", ellipse}}

The cat animation code keeps a counter, `angle`, for the current angle
of the animation and increments it every time the `animate` function
is called. It can then use this angle to compute the current position
of the image element. The `top` style is computed with `Math.sin` and
multiplied by 20, which is the vertical radius of our ellipse. The
`left` style is based on `Math.cos` and multiplied by 200 so that the
ellipse is much wider than it is high.

{{index "unit (CSS)"}}

Note that styles usually need _units_. In this case, we have to append
`"px"` to the number to tell the browser that we are counting in ((pixel))s
(as opposed to centimeters, "ems", or other units). This is easy to
forget. Using numbers without units will result in your style being
ignored—unless the number is 0, which always means the same thing,
regardless of its unit.

## Summary

JavaScript programs may inspect and interfere with the document that
the browser is displaying through a data structure called the DOM.
This data structure represents the browser's model of the document,
and a JavaScript program can modify it to change the visible document.

The DOM is organized like a tree, in which elements are arranged
hierarchically according to the structure of the document. The objects
representing elements have properties such as `parentNode` and
`childNodes`, which can be used to navigate through this tree.

The way a document is displayed can be influenced by _styling_, both
by attaching styles to nodes directly and by defining rules that match
certain nodes. There are many different style properties, such as
`color` or `display`. JavaScript code can manipulate an element's
style directly through its `style` property.

## Exercises

{{id exercise_table}}

### Build a table

{{index "table (HTML tag)"}}

An ((HTML)) table is built with the following tag structure:

```{lang: "text/html"}
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>height</th>
    <th>place</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kilimanjaro</td>
    <td>5895</td>
    <td>Tanzania</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

{{index "tr (HTML tag)", "th (HTML tag)", "td (HTML tag)"}}

For each _((row))_, the `<table>` tag contains a `<tr>` tag. Inside of
these `<tr>` tags, we can put cell elements: either heading cells
(`<th>`) or regular cells (`<td>`).

Given a data set of mountains, an array of objects with `name`,
`height`, and `place` properties, generate the DOM structure for a
table that enumerates the objects. It should have one column per key
and one row per object, plus a header row with `<th>` elements at the
top, listing the column names.

Write this so that the columns are automatically derived from the
objects, by taking the property names of the first object in the data.

Add the resulting table to the element with an `id` attribute of
`"mountains"` so that it becomes visible in the document.

{{index "right-aligning", "text-align (CSS)"}}

Once you have this working, right-align cells that contain number
values by setting their `style.textAlign` property to `"right"`.

{{if interactive

```{test: no, lang: "text/html"}
<h1>Mountains</h1>

<div id="mountains"></div>

<script>
  const MOUNTAINS = [
    {name: "Kilimanjaro", height: 5895, place: "Tanzania"},
    {name: "Everest", height: 8848, place: "Nepal"},
    {name: "Mount Fuji", height: 3776, place: "Japan"},
    {name: "Vaalserberg", height: 323, place: "Netherlands"},
    {name: "Denali", height: 6168, place: "United States"},
    {name: "Popocatepetl", height: 5465, place: "Mexico"},
    {name: "Mont Blanc", height: 4808, place: "Italy/France"}
  ];

  // Your code here
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "createElement method", "table example", "appendChild method"}}

You can use `document.createElement` to create new element nodes,
`document.createTextNode` to create text nodes, and the `appendChild`
method to put nodes into other nodes.

{{index "Object.keys function"}}

You'll want to loop over the key names once to fill in the top row and
then again for each object in the array to construct the data rows. To
get an array of key names from the first object, `Object.keys` will be
useful.

{{index "getElementById method", "querySelector method"}}

To add the table to the correct parent node, you can use
`document.getElementById` or `document.querySelector` to find the node
with the proper `id` attribute.

hint}}

### Elements by tag name

{{index "getElementsByTagName method", recursion}}

The `document.getElementsByTagName` method returns all child elements
with a given tag name. Implement your own version of this as a
function that takes a node and a string (the tag name) as arguments
and returns an array containing all descendant element nodes with the
given tag name.

{{index "nodeName property", capitalization, "toLowerCase method", "toUpperCase method"}}

To find the tag name of an element, use its `nodeName` property. But
note that this will return the tag name in all uppercase. Use the
`toLowerCase` or `toUpperCase` string methods to compensate for this.

{{if interactive

```{lang: "text/html", test: no}
<h1>Heading with a <span>span</span> element.</h1>
<p>A paragraph with <span>one</span>, <span>two</span>
  spans.</p>

<script>
  function byTagName(node, tagName) {
    // Your code here.
  }

  console.log(byTagName(document.body, "h1").length);
  // → 1
  console.log(byTagName(document.body, "span").length);
  // → 3
  let para = document.querySelector("p");
  console.log(byTagName(para, "span").length);
  // → 2
</script>
```
if}}

{{hint

{{index "getElementsByTagName method", recursion}}

The solution is most easily expressed with a recursive function,
similar to the [`talksAbout` function](dom#talksAbout) defined earlier
in this chapter.

{{index concatenation, "concat method", closure}}

You could call `byTagname` itself recursively, concatenating the
resulting arrays to produce the output. Or you could create an inner
function that calls itself recursively and that has access to an array
binding defined in the outer function, to which it can add the
matching elements it finds. Don't forget to call the ((inner
function)) once from the outer function to start the process.

{{index "nodeType property", "ELEMENT_NODE code"}}

The recursive function must check the node type. Here we are
interested only in node type 1 (`Node.ELEMENT_NODE`). For such
nodes, we must loop over their children and, for each child, see
whether the child matches the query while also doing a recursive call
on it to inspect its own children.

hint}}

### The cat's hat

{{index "cat's hat (exercise)"}}

Extend the cat ((animation)) defined [earlier](dom#animation) so that
both the cat and his hat (`<img src="img/hat.png">`) orbit at opposite
sides of the ellipse.

Or make the hat circle around the cat. Or alter the animation in some
other interesting way.

{{index "absolute positioning", "top (CSS)", "left (CSS)", "position (CSS)"}}

To make positioning multiple objects easier, it is probably a good
idea to switch to absolute positioning. This means that `top` and
`left` are counted relative to the top left of the document. To avoid
using negative coordinates, which would cause the image to move
outside of the visible page, you can add a fixed number of pixels to
the position values.

{{if interactive

```{lang: "text/html", test: no}
<style>body { min-height: 200px }</style>
<img src="img/cat.png" id="cat" style="position: absolute">
<img src="img/hat.png" id="hat" style="position: absolute">

<script>
  let cat = document.querySelector("#cat");
  let hat = document.querySelector("#hat");

  let angle = 0;
  let lastTime = null;
  function animate(time) {
    if (lastTime != null) angle += (time - lastTime) * 0.001;
    lastTime = time;
    cat.style.top = (Math.sin(angle) * 40 + 40) + "px";
    cat.style.left = (Math.cos(angle) * 200 + 230) + "px";

    // Your extensions here.

    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

`Math.cos` and `Math.sin` measure angles in radians, where a full
circle is 2π. For a given angle, you can get the opposite angle by
adding half of this, which is `Math.PI`. This can be useful for
putting the hat on the opposite side of the orbit.
