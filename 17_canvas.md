# Drawing on Canvas

{{quote {author: "M.C. Escher", title: "cited by Bruno Ernst in The Magic Mirror of M.C. Escher", chapter: true}

Drawing is deception.

{{index "Escher, M.C."}}

{{figure {url: "img/chapter_picture_17.jpg", alt: "Picture of a robot arm drawing on paper", chapter: "framed"}}}

{{index CSS, "transform (CSS)"}}

Browsers give us several ways to display ((graphics)). The simplest
way is to use styles to position and color regular ((DOM)) elements.
This can get you quite far, as the game in the [previous
chapter](game) showed. By adding partially transparent background
((image))s to the nodes, we can make them look exactly the way we
want. It is even possible to rotate or skew nodes with the `transform`
style.

But we'd be using the DOM for something that it wasn't originally
designed for. Some tasks, such as drawing a ((line)) between
arbitrary points, are extremely awkward to do with regular
((HTML)) elements.

{{index SVG, "img (HTML tag)"}}

There are two alternatives. The first is DOM-based but utilizes
_Scalable Vector Graphics_ (SVG), rather than HTML. Think of SVG as a
((document))-markup dialect that focuses on ((shape))s rather than
text. You can embed an SVG document directly in an HTML document or
include it with an `<img>` tag.

{{index clearing}}

The second alternative is called a _((canvas))_. A canvas is a single
((DOM)) element that encapsulates a ((picture)). It provides a
programming ((interface)) for drawing ((shape))s onto the space taken
up by the node. The main difference between a canvas and an SVG
picture is that in SVG the original description of the shapes is
preserved so that they can be moved or resized at any time. A canvas,
on the other hand, converts the shapes to ((pixel))s (colored dots on
a raster) as soon as they are drawn and does not remember what these
pixels represent. The only way to move a shape on a canvas is to clear
the canvas (or the part of the canvas around the shape) and redraw it
with the shape in a new position.

## SVG

This book will not go into ((SVG)) in detail, but I will briefly
explain how it works. At the [end of the
chapter](canvas#graphics_tradeoffs), I'll come back to the trade-offs
that you must consider when deciding which ((drawing)) mechanism is
appropriate for a given application.

This is an HTML document with a simple SVG ((picture)) in it:

```{lang: "text/html", sandbox: "svg"}
<p>Normal HTML here.</p>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <circle r="50" cx="50" cy="50" fill="red"/>
  <rect x="120" y="5" width="90" height="90"
        stroke="blue" fill="none"/>
</svg>
```

{{index "circle (SVG tag)", "rect (SVG tag)", "XML namespace", XML, "xmlns attribute"}}

The `xmlns` attribute changes an element (and its children) to a
different _XML namespace_. This namespace, identified by a ((URL)),
specifies the dialect that we are currently speaking. The `<circle>`
and `<rect>` tags, which do not exist in HTML, do have a meaning in
SVG—they draw shapes using the style and position specified by their
attributes.

{{if book

The document is displayed like this:

{{figure {url: "img/svg-demo.png", alt: "An embedded SVG image",width: "4.5cm"}}}

if}}

These tags create ((DOM)) elements, just like ((HTML)) tags, that
scripts can interact with. For example, this changes the `<circle>`
element to be ((color))ed cyan instead:

```{sandbox: "svg"}
let circle = document.querySelector("circle");
circle.setAttribute("fill", "cyan");
```

## The canvas element

{{index [canvas, size], "canvas (HTML tag)"}}

Canvas ((graphics)) can be drawn onto a `<canvas>` element. You can
give such an element `width` and `height` attributes to determine its
size in ((pixel))s.

A new canvas is empty, meaning it is entirely ((transparent)) and thus
shows up as empty space in the document.

{{index "2d (canvas context)", "webgl (canvas context)", OpenGL, [canvas, context], dimensions}}

The `<canvas>` tag is intended to allow different styles of
((drawing)). To get access to an actual drawing ((interface)), we
first need to create a _((context))_, an object whose methods provide
the drawing interface. There are currently two widely supported
drawing styles: `"2d"` for two-dimensional graphics and `"webgl"` for
three-dimensional graphics through the OpenGL interface.

{{index rendering, graphics, efficiency}}

This book won't discuss WebGL—we'll stick to two dimensions. But if
you are interested in three-dimensional graphics, I do encourage you
to look into WebGL. It provides a direct interface to graphics
hardware and allows you to render even complicated scenes efficiently,
using JavaScript.

{{index "getContext method", [canvas, context]}}

You create a ((context)) with the `getContext` method on the
`<canvas>` DOM element.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<p>Before canvas.</p>
<canvas width="120" height="60"></canvas>
<p>After canvas.</p>
<script>
  let canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
  let context = canvas.getContext("2d");
  context.fillStyle = "red";
  context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 50);
</script>
```

After creating the context object, the example draws a red
((rectangle)) 100 ((pixel))s wide and 50 pixels high, with its top-left
corner at coordinates (10,10).

{{if book

{{figure {url: "img/canvas_fill.png", alt: "A canvas with a rectangle",width: "2.5cm"}}}

if}}

{{index SVG, coordinates}}

Just like in ((HTML)) (and SVG), the coordinate system that the canvas
uses puts (0,0) at the top-left corner, and the positive y-((axis))
goes down from there. So (10,10) is 10 pixels below and to the right
of the top-left corner.

{{id fill_stroke}}

## Lines and surfaces

{{index filling, stroking, drawing, SVG}}

In the ((canvas)) interface, a shape can be _filled_, meaning its area
is given a certain color or pattern, or it can be _stroked_, which
means a ((line)) is drawn along its edge. The same terminology is used
by SVG.

{{index "fillRect method", "strokeRect method"}}

The `fillRect` method fills a ((rectangle)). It takes first the x- and
y-((coordinates)) of the rectangle's top-left corner, then its width,
and then its height. A similar method, `strokeRect`, draws the
((outline)) of a rectangle.

{{index property, state}}

Neither method takes any further parameters. The color of the fill,
thickness of the stroke, and so on, are not determined by an argument
to the method (as you might reasonably expect) but rather by
properties of the context object.

{{index filling, "fillStyle property"}}

The `fillStyle` property controls the way shapes are filled. It can be
set to a string that specifies a ((color)), using the color notation
used by ((CSS)).

{{index stroking, "line width", "strokeStyle property", "lineWidth property", canvas}}

The `strokeStyle` property works similarly but determines the color
used for a stroked line. The width of that line is determined by the
`lineWidth` property, which may contain any positive number.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.strokeStyle = "blue";
  cx.strokeRect(5, 5, 50, 50);
  cx.lineWidth = 5;
  cx.strokeRect(135, 5, 50, 50);
</script>
```

{{if book

This code draws two blue squares, using a thicker line for the second
one.

{{figure {url: "img/canvas_stroke.png", alt: "Two stroked squares",width: "5cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "default value", [canvas, size]}}

When no `width` or `height` attribute is specified, as in the example,
a canvas element gets a default width of 300 pixels and height of 150
pixels.

## Paths

{{index [path, canvas], [interface, design], [canvas, path]}}

A path is a sequence of ((line))s. The 2D canvas interface takes a
peculiar approach to describing such a path. It is done entirely
through ((side effect))s. Paths are not values that can be stored and
passed around. Instead, if you want to do something with a path, you
make a sequence of method calls to describe its shape.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  for (let y = 10; y < 100; y += 10) {
    cx.moveTo(10, y);
    cx.lineTo(90, y);
  }
  cx.stroke();
</script>
```

{{index canvas, "stroke method", "lineTo method", "moveTo method", shape}}

This example creates a path with a number of horizontal ((line))
segments and then strokes it using the `stroke` method. Each segment
created with `lineTo` starts at the path's _current_ position. That
position is usually the end of the last segment, unless `moveTo` was
called. In that case, the next segment would start at the position
passed to `moveTo`.

{{if book

The path described by the previous program looks like this:

{{figure {url: "img/canvas_path.png", alt: "Stroking a number of lines",width: "2.1cm"}}}

if}}

{{index [path, canvas], filling, [path, closing], "fill method"}}

When filling a path (using the `fill` method), each ((shape)) is
filled separately. A path can contain multiple shapes—each `moveTo`
motion starts a new one. But the path needs to be _closed_ (meaning
its start and end are in the same position) before it can be filled.
If the path is not already closed, a line is added from its end to its
start, and the shape enclosed by the completed path is filled.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  cx.moveTo(50, 10);
  cx.lineTo(10, 70);
  cx.lineTo(90, 70);
  cx.fill();
</script>
```

This example draws a filled triangle. Note that only two of the
triangle's sides are explicitly drawn. The third, from the
bottom-right corner back to the top, is implied and wouldn't be there
when you stroke the path.

{{if book

{{figure {url: "img/canvas_triangle.png", alt: "Filling a path",width: "2.2cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "stroke method", "closePath method", [path, closing], canvas}}

You could also use the `closePath` method to explicitly close a path
by adding an actual ((line)) segment back to the path's start. This
segment _is_ drawn when stroking the path.

## Curves

{{index [path, canvas], canvas, drawing}}

A path may also contain ((curve))d ((line))s. These are unfortunately
a bit more involved to draw.

{{index "quadraticCurveTo method"}}

The `quadraticCurveTo` method draws a curve to a given point. To
determine the curvature of the line, the method is given a ((control
point)) as well as a destination point. Imagine this control point as
_attracting_ the line, giving it its curve. The line won't go through
the control point, but its direction at the start and end points will
be such that a straight line in that direction would point toward the
control point. The following example illustrates this:

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  cx.moveTo(10, 90);
  // control=(60,10) goal=(90,90)
  cx.quadraticCurveTo(60, 10, 90, 90);
  cx.lineTo(60, 10);
  cx.closePath();
  cx.stroke();
</script>
```

{{if book

It produces a path that looks like this:

{{figure {url: "img/canvas_quadraticcurve.png", alt: "A quadratic curve",width: "2.3cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "stroke method"}}

We draw a ((quadratic curve)) from the left to the right, with (60,10)
as control point, and then draw two ((line)) segments going through
that control point and back to the start of the line. The result
somewhat resembles a _((Star Trek))_ insignia. You can see the effect
of the control point: the lines leaving the lower corners start off in
the direction of the control point and then ((curve)) toward their
target.

{{index canvas, "bezierCurveTo method"}}

The `bezierCurveTo` method draws a similar kind of curve. Instead of a
single ((control point)), this one has two—one for each of the
((line))'s endpoints. Here is a similar sketch to illustrate the
behavior of such a curve:

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  cx.moveTo(10, 90);
  // control1=(10,10) control2=(90,10) goal=(50,90)
  cx.bezierCurveTo(10, 10, 90, 10, 50, 90);
  cx.lineTo(90, 10);
  cx.lineTo(10, 10);
  cx.closePath();
  cx.stroke();
</script>
```

The two control points specify the direction at both ends of the
curve. The farther they are away from their corresponding point, the
more the curve will "bulge" in that direction.

{{if book

{{figure {url: "img/canvas_beziercurve.png", alt: "A bezier curve",width: "2.2cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "trial and error"}}

Such ((curve))s can be hard to work with—it's not always clear how to
find the ((control point))s that provide the ((shape)) you are looking
for. Sometimes you can compute them, and sometimes you'll just have to
find a suitable value by trial and error.

{{index "arc method", arc}}

The `arc` method is a way to draw a line that curves along the edge of
a circle. It takes a pair of ((coordinates)) for the arc's center, a
radius, and then a start angle and end angle.

{{index pi, "Math.PI constant"}}

Those last two parameters make it possible to draw only part of the
circle. The ((angle))s are measured in ((radian))s, not ((degree))s.
This means a full ((circle)) has an angle of 2π, or `2 * Math.PI`,
which is about 6.28. The angle starts counting at the point to the
right of the circle's center and goes clockwise from there. You can
use a start of 0 and an end bigger than 2π (say, 7) to draw a full
circle.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  // center=(50,50) radius=40 angle=0 to 7
  cx.arc(50, 50, 40, 0, 7);
  // center=(150,50) radius=40 angle=0 to ½π
  cx.arc(150, 50, 40, 0, 0.5 * Math.PI);
  cx.stroke();
</script>
```

{{index "moveTo method", "arc method", [path, " canvas"]}}

The resulting picture contains a ((line)) from the right of the full
circle (first call to `arc`) to the right of the quarter-((circle))
(second call). Like other path-drawing methods, a line drawn with
`arc` is connected to the previous path segment. You can call `moveTo`
or start a new path to avoid this.

{{if book

{{figure {url: "img/canvas_circle.png", alt: "Drawing a circle",width: "4.9cm"}}}

if}}

{{id pie_chart}}

## Drawing a pie chart

{{index "pie chart example"}}

Imagine you've just taken a ((job)) at EconomiCorp, Inc., and your
first assignment is to draw a pie chart of its customer satisfaction
((survey)) results.

The `results` binding contains an array of objects that represent the
survey responses.

```{sandbox: "pie", includeCode: true}
const results = [
  {name: "Satisfied", count: 1043, color: "lightblue"},
  {name: "Neutral", count: 563, color: "lightgreen"},
  {name: "Unsatisfied", count: 510, color: "pink"},
  {name: "No comment", count: 175, color: "silver"}
];
```

{{index "pie chart example"}}

To draw a pie chart, we draw a number of pie slices, each made up of
an ((arc)) and a pair of ((line))s to the center of that arc. We can
compute the ((angle)) taken up by each arc by dividing a full circle
(2π) by the total number of responses and then multiplying that number
(the angle per response) by the number of people who picked a given
choice.

```{lang: "text/html", sandbox: "pie"}
<canvas width="200" height="200"></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  let total = results
    .reduce((sum, {count}) => sum + count, 0);
  // Start at the top
  let currentAngle = -0.5 * Math.PI;
  for (let result of results) {
    let sliceAngle = (result.count / total) * 2 * Math.PI;
    cx.beginPath();
    // center=100,100, radius=100
    // from current angle, clockwise by slice's angle
    cx.arc(100, 100, 100,
           currentAngle, currentAngle + sliceAngle);
    currentAngle += sliceAngle;
    cx.lineTo(100, 100);
    cx.fillStyle = result.color;
    cx.fill();
  }
</script>
```

{{if book

This draws the following chart:

{{figure {url: "img/canvas_pie_chart.png", alt: "A pie chart",width: "5cm"}}}

if}}

But a chart that doesn't tell us what the slices mean isn't very
helpful. We need a way to draw text to the ((canvas)).

## Text

{{index stroking, filling, "fillStyle property", "fillText method", "strokeText method"}}

A 2D canvas drawing context provides the methods `fillText` and
`strokeText`. The latter can be useful for outlining letters, but
usually `fillText` is what you need. It will fill the outline of the
given ((text)) with the current `fillStyle`.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.font = "28px Georgia";
  cx.fillStyle = "fuchsia";
  cx.fillText("I can draw text, too!", 10, 50);
</script>
```

You can specify the size, style, and ((font)) of the text with the
`font` property. This example just gives a font size and family name.
It is also possible to add `italic` or `bold` to the start of the
string to select a style.

{{index "fillText method", "strokeText method", "textAlign property", "textBaseline property"}}

The last two arguments to `fillText` and `strokeText` provide the
position at which the font is drawn. By default, they indicate the
position of the start of the text's alphabetic baseline, which is the
line that letters "stand" on, not counting hanging parts in letters
such as _j_ or _p_. You can change the horizontal position by setting the
`textAlign` property to `"end"` or `"center"` and the vertical
position by setting `textBaseline` to `"top"`, `"middle"`, or
`"bottom"`.

{{index "pie chart example"}}

We'll come back to our pie chart, and the problem of ((label))ing the
slices, in the [exercises](canvas#exercise_pie_chart) at the end of
the chapter.

## Images

{{index "vector graphics", "bitmap graphics"}}

In computer ((graphics)), a distinction is often made between _vector_
graphics and _bitmap_ graphics. The first is what we have been doing
so far in this chapter—specifying a picture by giving a logical
description of ((shape))s. Bitmap graphics, on the other hand, don't
specify actual shapes but rather work with ((pixel)) data (rasters of
colored dots).

{{index "load event", "event handling", "img (HTML tag)", "drawImage method"}}

The `drawImage` method allows us to draw ((pixel)) data onto a
((canvas)). This pixel data can originate from an `<img>` element or
from another canvas. The following example creates a detached `<img>`
element and loads an image file into it. But it cannot immediately
start drawing from this picture because the browser may not have
loaded it yet. To deal with this, we register a `"load"` event handler
and do the drawing after the image has loaded.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  let img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = "img/hat.png";
  img.addEventListener("load", () => {
    for (let x = 10; x < 200; x += 30) {
      cx.drawImage(img, x, 10);
    }
  });
</script>
```

{{index "drawImage method", scaling}}

By default, `drawImage` will draw the image at its original size. You
can also give it two additional arguments to set a different width
and height.

When `drawImage` is given _nine_ arguments, it can be used to draw
only a fragment of an image. The second through fifth arguments
indicate the rectangle (x, y, width, and height) in the source image
that should be copied, and the sixth to ninth arguments give the
rectangle (on the canvas) into which it should be copied.

{{index "player character", "pixel art"}}

This can be used to pack multiple _((sprite))s_ (image elements) into
a single image file and then draw only the part you need. For example,
we have this picture containing a game character in multiple
((pose))s:

{{figure {url: "img/player_big.png", alt: "Various poses of a game character",width: "6cm"}}}

By alternating which pose we draw, we can show an ((animation)) that
looks like a walking character.

{{index "fillRect method", "clearRect method", clearing}}

To animate a ((picture)) on a ((canvas)), the `clearRect` method is
useful. It resembles `fillRect`, but instead of coloring the
rectangle, it makes it ((transparent)), removing the previously drawn
pixels.

{{index "setInterval function", "img (HTML tag)"}}

We know that each _((sprite))_, each subpicture, is 24 ((pixel))s wide
and 30 pixels high. The following code loads the image and then sets
up an interval (repeated timer) to draw the next ((frame)):

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  let img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = "img/player.png";
  let spriteW = 24, spriteH = 30;
  img.addEventListener("load", () => {
    let cycle = 0;
    setInterval(() => {
      cx.clearRect(0, 0, spriteW, spriteH);
      cx.drawImage(img,
                   // source rectangle
                   cycle * spriteW, 0, spriteW, spriteH,
                   // destination rectangle
                   0,               0, spriteW, spriteH);
      cycle = (cycle + 1) % 8;
    }, 120);
  });
</script>
```

{{index "remainder operator", "% operator"}}

The `cycle` binding tracks our position in the ((animation)). For each
((frame)), it is incremented and then clipped back to the 0 to 7 range
by using the remainder operator. This binding is then used to compute
the x-coordinate that the sprite for the current pose has in the
picture.

## Transformation

{{index transformation, mirroring}}

{{indexsee flipping, mirroring}}

But what if we want our character to walk to the left instead of to
the right? We could draw another set of sprites, of course. But we can
also instruct the ((canvas)) to draw the picture the other way round.

{{index "scale method", scaling}}

Calling the `scale` method will cause anything drawn after it to be
scaled. This method takes two parameters, one to set a horizontal
scale and one to set a vertical scale.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.scale(3, .5);
  cx.beginPath();
  cx.arc(50, 50, 40, 0, 7);
  cx.lineWidth = 3;
  cx.stroke();
</script>
```

{{if book

Because of the call to `scale`, the circle is drawn three times as wide
and half as high.

{{figure {url: "img/canvas_scale.png", alt: "A scaled circle",width: "6.6cm"}}}

if}}

{{index mirroring}}

Scaling will cause everything about the drawn image, including the
((line width)), to be stretched out or squeezed together as specified.
Scaling by a negative amount will flip the picture around. The
flipping happens around point (0,0), which means it will also flip the
direction of the coordinate system. When a horizontal scaling of -1 is
applied, a shape drawn at x position 100 will end up at what used to
be position -100.

{{index "drawImage method"}}

So to turn a picture around, we can't simply add `cx.scale(-1, 1)`
before the call to `drawImage` because that would move our picture
outside of the ((canvas)), where it won't be visible. You could adjust
the ((coordinates)) given to `drawImage` to compensate for this by
drawing the image at x position -50 instead of 0. Another solution,
which doesn't require the code that does the drawing to know about the
scale change, is to adjust the ((axis)) around which the scaling
happens.

{{index "rotate method", "translate method", transformation}}

There are several other methods besides `scale` that influence the
coordinate system for a ((canvas)). You can rotate subsequently drawn
shapes with the `rotate` method and move them with the `translate`
method. The interesting—and confusing—thing is that these
transformations _stack_, meaning that each one happens relative to the
previous transformations.

{{index "rotate method", "translate method"}}

So if we translate by 10 horizontal pixels twice, everything will be
drawn 20 pixels to the right. If we first move the center of the
coordinate system to (50,50) and then rotate by 20 ((degree))s (about
0.1π ((radian))s), that rotation will happen _around_ point (50,50).

{{figure {url: "img/transform.svg", alt: "Stacking transformations",width: "9cm"}}}

{{index coordinates}}

But if we _first_ rotate by 20 degrees and _then_ translate by
(50,50), the translation will happen in the rotated coordinate system
and thus produce a different orientation. The order in which
transformations are applied matters.

{{index axis, mirroring}}

To flip a picture around the vertical line at a given x position, we
can do the following:

```{includeCode: true}
function flipHorizontally(context, around) {
  context.translate(around, 0);
  context.scale(-1, 1);
  context.translate(-around, 0);
}
```

{{index "flipHorizontally method"}}

We move the y-((axis)) to where we want our ((mirror)) to be, apply
the mirroring, and finally move the y-axis back to its proper place in
the mirrored universe. The following picture explains why this works:

{{figure {url: "img/mirror.svg", alt: "Mirroring around a vertical line",width: "8cm"}}}

{{index "translate method", "scale method", transformation, canvas}}

This shows the coordinate systems before and after mirroring across
the central line. The triangles are numbered to illustrate each step.
If we draw a triangle at a positive x position, it would, by default,
be in the place where triangle 1 is. A call to `flipHorizontally`
first does a translation to the right, which gets us to triangle 2. It
then scales, flipping the triangle over to position 3. This is not
where it should be, if it were mirrored in the given line. The second
`translate` call fixes this—it "cancels" the initial translation and
makes triangle 4 appear exactly where it should.

We can now draw a mirrored character at position (100,0) by flipping
the world around the character's vertical center.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  let img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = "img/player.png";
  let spriteW = 24, spriteH = 30;
  img.addEventListener("load", () => {
    flipHorizontally(cx, 100 + spriteW / 2);
    cx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, spriteW, spriteH,
                 100, 0, spriteW, spriteH);
  });

```

## Storing and clearing transformations

{{index "side effect", canvas, transformation}}

Transformations stick around. Everything else we draw after
((drawing)) that mirrored character would also be mirrored. That might
be inconvenient.

It is possible to save the current transformation, do some drawing and
transforming, and then restore the old transformation. This is usually
the proper thing to do for a function that needs to temporarily
transform the coordinate system. First, we save whatever
transformation the code that called the function was using. Then the
function does its thing, adding more transformations on top of the
current transformation. Finally, we revert to the
transformation we started with.

{{index "save method", "restore method"}}

The `save` and `restore` methods on the 2D ((canvas)) context do this
((transformation)) management. They conceptually keep a stack of
transformation ((state))s. When you call `save`, the current state is
pushed onto the stack, and when you call `restore`, the state on top
of the stack is taken off and used as the context's current
transformation. You can also call `resetTransform` to fully reset the
transformation.

{{index "branching recursion", "fractal example", recursion}}

The `branch` function in the following example illustrates what you
can do with a function that changes the transformation and then calls
a function (in this case itself), which continues drawing with
the given transformation.

This function draws a treelike shape by drawing a line, moving the
center of the coordinate system to the end of the line, and calling
itself twice—first rotated to the left and then rotated to the right.
Every call reduces the length of the branch drawn, and the recursion
stops when the length drops below 8.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<canvas width="600" height="300"></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  function branch(length, angle, scale) {
    cx.fillRect(0, 0, 1, length);
    if (length < 8) return;
    cx.save();
    cx.translate(0, length);
    cx.rotate(-angle);
    branch(length * scale, angle, scale);
    cx.rotate(2 * angle);
    branch(length * scale, angle, scale);
    cx.restore();
  }
  cx.translate(300, 0);
  branch(60, 0.5, 0.8);
</script>
```

{{if book

The result is a simple fractal.

{{figure {url: "img/canvas_tree.png", alt: "A recursive picture",width: "5cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "save method", "restore method", canvas, "rotate method"}}

If the calls to `save` and `restore` were not there, the second
recursive call to `branch` would end up with the position and rotation
created by the first call. It wouldn't be connected to the current
branch but rather to the innermost, rightmost branch drawn by the
first call. The resulting shape might also be interesting, but it is
definitely not a tree.

{{id canvasdisplay}}

## Back to the game

{{index "drawImage method"}}

We now know enough about ((canvas)) drawing to start working on a
((canvas))-based ((display)) system for the ((game)) from the
[previous chapter](game). The new display will no longer be showing
just colored boxes. Instead, we'll use `drawImage` to draw pictures
that represent the game's elements.

{{index "CanvasDisplay class", "DOMDisplay class"}}

We define another display object type called `CanvasDisplay`,
supporting the same ((interface)) as `DOMDisplay` from [Chapter
?](game#domdisplay), namely, the methods `syncState` and `clear`.

{{index state}}

This object keeps a little more information than `DOMDisplay`. Rather
than using the scroll position of its DOM element, it tracks its own
((viewport)), which tells us what part of the level we are currently
looking at. Finally, it keeps a `flipPlayer` property so that even
when the player is standing still, it keeps facing the direction it
last moved in.

```{sandbox: "game", includeCode: true}
class CanvasDisplay {
  constructor(parent, level) {
    this.canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
    this.canvas.width = Math.min(600, level.width * scale);
    this.canvas.height = Math.min(450, level.height * scale);
    parent.appendChild(this.canvas);
    this.cx = this.canvas.getContext("2d");

    this.flipPlayer = false;

    this.viewport = {
      left: 0,
      top: 0,
      width: this.canvas.width / scale,
      height: this.canvas.height / scale
    };
  }

  clear() {
    this.canvas.remove();
  }
}
```

The `syncState` method first computes a new viewport and then draws
the game scene at the appropriate position.

```{sandbox: "game", includeCode: true}
CanvasDisplay.prototype.syncState = function(state) {
  this.updateViewport(state);
  this.clearDisplay(state.status);
  this.drawBackground(state.level);
  this.drawActors(state.actors);
};
```

{{index scrolling, clearing}}

Contrary to `DOMDisplay`, this display style _does_ have to redraw the
background on every update. Because shapes on a canvas are just
((pixel))s, after we draw them there is no good way to move them (or
remove them). The only way to update the canvas display is to clear it
and redraw the scene. We may also have scrolled, which requires the
background to be in a different position.

{{index "CanvasDisplay class"}}

The `updateViewport` method is similar to `DOMDisplay`'s
`scrollPlayerIntoView` method. It checks whether the player is too
close to the edge of the screen and moves the ((viewport)) when this
is the case.

```{sandbox: "game", includeCode: true}
CanvasDisplay.prototype.updateViewport = function(state) {
  let view = this.viewport, margin = view.width / 3;
  let player = state.player;
  let center = player.pos.plus(player.size.times(0.5));

  if (center.x < view.left + margin) {
    view.left = Math.max(center.x - margin, 0);
  } else if (center.x > view.left + view.width - margin) {
    view.left = Math.min(center.x + margin - view.width,
                         state.level.width - view.width);
  }
  if (center.y < view.top + margin) {
    view.top = Math.max(center.y - margin, 0);
  } else if (center.y > view.top + view.height - margin) {
    view.top = Math.min(center.y + margin - view.height,
                        state.level.height - view.height);
  }
};
```

{{index boundary, "Math.max function", "Math.min function", clipping}}

The calls to `Math.max` and `Math.min` ensure that the viewport does
not end up showing space outside of the level. `Math.max(x, 0)` makes
sure the resulting number is not less than zero. `Math.min`
similarly guarantees that a value stays below a given bound.

When ((clearing)) the display, we'll use a slightly different
((color)) depending on whether the game is won (brighter) or lost
(darker).

```{sandbox: "game", includeCode: true}
CanvasDisplay.prototype.clearDisplay = function(status) {
  if (status == "won") {
    this.cx.fillStyle = "rgb(68, 191, 255)";
  } else if (status == "lost") {
    this.cx.fillStyle = "rgb(44, 136, 214)";
  } else {
    this.cx.fillStyle = "rgb(52, 166, 251)";
  }
  this.cx.fillRect(0, 0,
                   this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);
};
```

{{index "Math.floor function", "Math.ceil function", rounding}}

To draw the background, we run through the tiles that are visible in
the current viewport, using the same trick used in the `touches`
method from the [previous chapter](game#touches).

```{sandbox: "game", includeCode: true}
let otherSprites = document.createElement("img");
otherSprites.src = "img/sprites.png";

CanvasDisplay.prototype.drawBackground = function(level) {
  let {left, top, width, height} = this.viewport;
  let xStart = Math.floor(left);
  let xEnd = Math.ceil(left + width);
  let yStart = Math.floor(top);
  let yEnd = Math.ceil(top + height);

  for (let y = yStart; y < yEnd; y++) {
    for (let x = xStart; x < xEnd; x++) {
      let tile = level.rows[y][x];
      if (tile == "empty") continue;
      let screenX = (x - left) * scale;
      let screenY = (y - top) * scale;
      let tileX = tile == "lava" ? scale : 0;
      this.cx.drawImage(otherSprites,
                        tileX,         0, scale, scale,
                        screenX, screenY, scale, scale);
    }
  }
};
```

{{index "drawImage method", sprite, tile}}

Tiles that are not empty are drawn with `drawImage`. The
`otherSprites` image contains the pictures used for elements other
than the player. It contains, from left to right, the wall tile, the
lava tile, and the sprite for a coin.

{{figure {url: "img/sprites_big.png", alt: "Sprites for our game",width: "1.4cm"}}}

{{index scaling}}

Background tiles are 20 by 20 pixels since we will use the same scale
that we used in `DOMDisplay`. Thus, the offset for lava tiles is 20
(the value of the `scale` binding), and the offset for walls is 0.

{{index drawing, "load event", "drawImage method"}}

We don't bother waiting for the sprite image to load. Calling
`drawImage` with an image that hasn't been loaded yet will simply do
nothing. Thus, we might fail to draw the game properly for the first
few ((frame))s, while the image is still loading, but that is not a
serious problem. Since we keep updating the screen, the correct scene
will appear as soon as the loading finishes.

{{index "player character", animation, drawing}}

The ((walking)) character shown earlier will be used to represent the
player. The code that draws it needs to pick the right ((sprite)) and
direction based on the player's current motion. The first eight
sprites contain a walking animation. When the player is moving along a
floor, we cycle through them based on the current time. We want to
switch frames every 60 milliseconds, so the ((time)) is divided by 60
first. When the player is standing still, we draw the ninth sprite.
During jumps, which are recognized by the fact that the vertical speed
is not zero, we use the tenth, rightmost sprite.

{{index "flipHorizontally function", "CanvasDisplay class"}}

Because the ((sprite))s are slightly wider than the player object—24
instead of 16 pixels to allow some space for feet and arms—the method
has to adjust the x-coordinate and width by a given amount
(`playerXOverlap`).

```{sandbox: "game", includeCode: true}
let playerSprites = document.createElement("img");
playerSprites.src = "img/player.png";
const playerXOverlap = 4;

CanvasDisplay.prototype.drawPlayer = function(player, x, y,
                                              width, height){
  width += playerXOverlap * 2;
  x -= playerXOverlap;
  if (player.speed.x != 0) {
    this.flipPlayer = player.speed.x < 0;
  }

  let tile = 8;
  if (player.speed.y != 0) {
    tile = 9;
  } else if (player.speed.x != 0) {
    tile = Math.floor(Date.now() / 60) % 8;
  }

  this.cx.save();
  if (this.flipPlayer) {
    flipHorizontally(this.cx, x + width / 2);
  }
  let tileX = tile * width;
  this.cx.drawImage(playerSprites, tileX, 0, width, height,
                                   x,     y, width, height);
  this.cx.restore();
};
```

The `drawPlayer` method is called by `drawActors`, which is
responsible for drawing all the actors in the game.

```{sandbox: "game", includeCode: true}
CanvasDisplay.prototype.drawActors = function(actors) {
  for (let actor of actors) {
    let width = actor.size.x * scale;
    let height = actor.size.y * scale;
    let x = (actor.pos.x - this.viewport.left) * scale;
    let y = (actor.pos.y - this.viewport.top) * scale;
    if (actor.type == "player") {
      this.drawPlayer(actor, x, y, width, height);
    } else {
      let tileX = (actor.type == "coin" ? 2 : 1) * scale;
      this.cx.drawImage(otherSprites,
                        tileX, 0, width, height,
                        x,     y, width, height);
    }
  }
};
```

When ((drawing)) something that is not the ((player)), we look at its
type to find the offset of the correct sprite. The ((lava)) tile is
found at offset 20, and the ((coin)) sprite is found at 40 (two times
`scale`).

{{index viewport}}

We have to subtract the viewport's position when computing the actor's
position since (0,0) on our ((canvas)) corresponds to the top left of
the viewport, not the top left of the level. We could also have used
`translate` for this. Either way works.

{{id graphics_tradeoffs}}

## Choosing a graphics interface

So when you need to generate graphics in the browser, you can choose
between plain ((HTML)), ((SVG)), and ((canvas)). There is no single
_best_ approach that works in all situations. Each option has
strengths and weaknesses.

{{index "text wrapping"}}

Plain HTML has the advantage of being simple. It also integrates well
with ((text)). Both SVG and canvas allow you to draw text, but they
won't help you position that text or wrap it when it takes up more
than one line. In an HTML-based picture, it is much easier to include
blocks of text.

{{index zooming, SVG}}

SVG can be used to produce ((crisp)) ((graphics)) that look good at
any zoom level. Unlike HTML, it is designed for drawing
and is thus more suitable for that purpose.

{{index DOM, SVG, "event handling"}}

Both SVG and HTML build up a ((data structure)) (the DOM) that
represents your picture. This makes it possible to modify elements
after they are drawn. If you need to repeatedly change a small part of
a big ((picture)) in response to what the user is doing or as part of
an ((animation)), doing it in a canvas can be needlessly expensive.
The DOM also allows us to register mouse event handlers on every
element in the picture (even on shapes drawn with SVG). You can't do
that with canvas.

{{index performance, optimization}}

But ((canvas))'s ((pixel))-oriented approach can be an advantage when
drawing a huge number of tiny elements. The fact that it does not
build up a data structure but only repeatedly draws onto the same
pixel surface gives canvas a lower cost per shape.

{{index "ray tracer"}}

There are also effects, such as rendering a scene one pixel at a time
(for example, using a ray tracer) or postprocessing an image with
JavaScript (blurring or distorting it), that can be realistically
handled only by a ((pixel))-based approach.

In some cases, you may want to combine several of these techniques.
For example, you might draw a ((graph)) with ((SVG)) or ((canvas)) but
show ((text))ual information by positioning an ((HTML)) element on top
of the picture.

{{index display}}

For nondemanding applications, it really doesn't matter much which
interface you choose. The display we built for our game in this
chapter could have been implemented using any of these three
((graphics)) technologies since it does not need to draw text, handle
mouse interaction, or work with an extraordinarily large number of
elements.

## Summary

In this chapter we discussed techniques for drawing graphics in the
browser, focusing on the `<canvas>` element.

A canvas node represents an area in a document that our program may
draw on. This drawing is done through a drawing context object,
created with the `getContext` method.

The 2D drawing interface allows us to fill and stroke various shapes.
The context's `fillStyle` property determines how shapes are filled.
The `strokeStyle` and `lineWidth` properties control the way lines are
drawn.

Rectangles and pieces of text can be drawn with a single method call.
The `fillRect` and `strokeRect` methods draw rectangles, and the
`fillText` and `strokeText` methods draw text. To create custom
shapes, we must first build up a path.

{{index stroking, filling}}

Calling `beginPath` starts a new path. A number of other methods add
lines and curves to the current path. For example, `lineTo` can add a
straight line. When a path is finished, it can be filled with the
`fill` method or stroked with the `stroke` method.

Moving pixels from an image or another canvas onto our canvas is done
with the `drawImage` method. By default, this method draws the whole
source image, but by giving it more parameters, you can copy a
specific area of the image. We used this for our game by copying
individual poses of the game character out of an image that contained
many such poses.

Transformations allow you to draw a shape in multiple orientations. A
2D drawing context has a current transformation that can be changed
with the `translate`, `scale`, and `rotate` methods. These will affect
all subsequent drawing operations. A transformation state can be saved
with the `save` method and restored with the `restore` method.

When showing an animation on a canvas, the `clearRect` method can be
used to clear part of the canvas before redrawing it.

## Exercises

### Shapes

{{index "shapes (exercise)"}}

Write a program that draws the following ((shape))s on a ((canvas)):

{{index rotation}}

1. A ((trapezoid)) (a ((rectangle)) that is wider on one side)

2. A red ((diamond)) (a rectangle rotated 45 degrees or ¼π radians)

3. A zigzagging ((line))

4. A ((spiral)) made up of 100 straight line segments

5. A yellow ((star))

{{figure {url: "img/exercise_shapes.png", alt: "The shapes to draw",width: "8cm"}}}

When drawing the last two, you may want to refer to the explanation of
`Math.cos` and `Math.sin` in [Chapter ?](dom#sin_cos), which describes
how to get coordinates on a circle using these functions.

{{index readability, "hard-coding"}}

I recommend creating a function for each shape. Pass the position, and
optionally other properties such as the size or the number of points,
as parameters. The alternative, which is to hard-code numbers all over
your code, tends to make the code needlessly hard to read and modify.

{{if interactive

```{lang: "text/html", test: no}
<canvas width="600" height="200"></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");

  // Your code here.
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index [path, canvas], "shapes (exercise)"}}

The ((trapezoid)) (1) is easiest to draw using a path. Pick suitable
center coordinates and add each of the four corners around the center.

{{index "flipHorizontally function", rotation}}

The ((diamond)) (2) can be drawn the straightforward way, with a path,
or the interesting way, with a `rotate` ((transformation)). To use
rotation, you will have to apply a trick similar to what we did in the
`flipHorizontally` function. Because you want to rotate around the
center of your rectangle and not around the point (0,0), you must
first `translate` to there, then rotate, and then translate back.

Make sure you reset the transformation after drawing any shape that
creates one.

{{index "remainder operator", "% operator"}}

For the ((zigzag)) (3) it becomes impractical to write a new call to
`lineTo` for each line segment. Instead, you should use a ((loop)).
You can have each iteration draw either two ((line)) segments (right
and then left again) or one, in which case you must use the evenness
(`% 2`) of the loop index to determine whether to go left or right.

You'll also need a loop for the ((spiral)) (4). If you draw a series
of points, with each point moving further along a circle around the
spiral's center, you get a circle. If, during the loop, you vary the
radius of the circle on which you are putting the current point and go
around more than once, the result is a spiral.

{{index "quadraticCurveTo method"}}

The ((star)) (5) depicted is built out of `quadraticCurveTo` lines.
You could also draw one with straight lines. Divide a circle into
eight pieces for a star with eight points, or however many pieces you
want. Draw lines between these points, making them curve toward the
center of the star. With `quadraticCurveTo`, you can use the center as
the control point.

hint}}

{{id exercise_pie_chart}}

### The pie chart

{{index label, text, "pie chart example"}}

[Earlier](canvas#pie_chart) in the chapter, we saw an example program
that drew a pie chart. Modify this program so that the name of each
category is shown next to the slice that represents it. Try to find a
pleasing-looking way to automatically position this text that would
work for other data sets as well. You may assume that categories are
big enough to leave ample room for their labels.

You might need `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` again, which are described in
[Chapter ?](dom#sin_cos).

{{if interactive

```{lang: "text/html", test: no}
<canvas width="600" height="300"></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  let total = results
    .reduce((sum, {count}) => sum + count, 0);
  let currentAngle = -0.5 * Math.PI;
  let centerX = 300, centerY = 150;

  // Add code to draw the slice labels in this loop.
  for (let result of results) {
    let sliceAngle = (result.count / total) * 2 * Math.PI;
    cx.beginPath();
    cx.arc(centerX, centerY, 100,
           currentAngle, currentAngle + sliceAngle);
    currentAngle += sliceAngle;
    cx.lineTo(centerX, centerY);
    cx.fillStyle = result.color;
    cx.fill();
  }
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "fillText method", "textAlign property", "textBaseline property", "pie chart example"}}

You will need to call `fillText` and set the context's `textAlign` and
`textBaseline` properties in such a way that the text ends up where
you want it.

A sensible way to position the labels would be to put the text on the
line going from the center of the pie through the middle of the slice.
You don't want to put the text directly against the side of the pie
but rather move the text out to the side of the pie by a given number
of pixels.

The ((angle)) of this line is `currentAngle + 0.5 * sliceAngle`. The
following code finds a position on this line 120 pixels from the
center:

```{test: no}
let middleAngle = currentAngle + 0.5 * sliceAngle;
let textX = Math.cos(middleAngle) * 120 + centerX;
let textY = Math.sin(middleAngle) * 120 + centerY;
```

For `textBaseline`, the value `"middle"` is probably appropriate when
using this approach. What to use for `textAlign` depends on which side
of the circle we are on. On the left, it should be `"right"`, and on
the right, it should be `"left"`, so that the text is positioned away
from the pie.

{{index "Math.cos function"}}

If you are not sure how to find out which side of the circle a given
angle is on, look to the explanation of `Math.cos` in [Chapter
?](dom#sin_cos). The cosine of an angle tells us which x-coordinate it
corresponds to, which in turn tells us exactly which side of the
circle we are on.

hint}}

### A bouncing ball

{{index animation, "requestAnimationFrame function", bouncing}}

Use the `requestAnimationFrame` technique that we saw in [Chapter
?](dom#animationFrame) and [Chapter ?](game#runAnimation) to draw a
((box)) with a bouncing ((ball)) in it. The ball moves at a constant
((speed)) and bounces off the box's sides when it hits them.

{{if interactive

```{lang: "text/html", test: no}
<canvas width="400" height="400"></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");

  let lastTime = null;
  function frame(time) {
    if (lastTime != null) {
      updateAnimation(Math.min(100, time - lastTime) / 1000);
    }
    lastTime = time;
    requestAnimationFrame(frame);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);

  function updateAnimation(step) {
    // Your code here.
  }
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "strokeRect method", animation, "arc method"}}

A ((box)) is easy to draw with `strokeRect`. Define a binding that
holds its size or define two bindings if your box's width and height
differ. To create a round ((ball)), start a path and call `arc(x, y,
radius, 0, 7)`, which creates an arc going from zero to more than a
whole circle. Then fill the path.

{{index "collision detection", "Vec class"}}

To model the ball's position and ((speed)), you can use the `Vec`
class from [Chapter ?](game#vector)[ (which is available on this
page)]{if interactive}. Give it a starting speed, preferably one that
is not purely vertical or horizontal, and for every ((frame)) multiply
that speed by the amount of time that elapsed. When the ball gets
too close to a vertical wall, invert the x component in its speed.
Likewise, invert the y component when it hits a horizontal wall.

{{index "clearRect method", clearing}}

After finding the ball's new position and speed, use `clearRect` to
delete the scene and redraw it using the new position.

hint}}

### Precomputed mirroring

{{index optimization, "bitmap graphics", mirror}}

One unfortunate thing about ((transformation))s is that they slow down
the drawing of bitmaps. The position and size of each ((pixel)) has to be
transformed, and though it is possible that ((browser))s will get
cleverer about transformation in the ((future)), they currently cause a
measurable increase in the time it takes to draw a bitmap.

In a game like ours, where we are drawing only a single transformed
sprite, this is a nonissue. But imagine that we need to draw hundreds
of characters or thousands of rotating particles from an explosion.

Think of a way to allow us to draw an inverted character without
loading additional image files and without having to make transformed
`drawImage` calls every frame.

{{hint

{{index mirror, scaling, "drawImage method"}}

The key to the solution is the fact that we can use a ((canvas))
element as a source image when using `drawImage`. It is possible to
create an extra `<canvas>` element, without adding it to the document,
and draw our inverted sprites to it, once. When drawing an actual
frame, we just copy the already inverted sprites to the main canvas.

{{index "load event"}}

Some care would be required because images do not load instantly. We
do the inverted drawing only once, and if we do it before the image
loads, it won't draw anything. A `"load"` handler on the image can be
used to draw the inverted images to the extra canvas. This canvas can
be used as a drawing source immediately (it'll simply be blank until
we draw the character onto it).

hint}}
