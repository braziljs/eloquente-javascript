# HTTP and Forms

{{quote {author: "Roy Fielding", title: "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures", chapter: true}

Communication must be stateless in nature [...] such that each request
from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to
understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored
context on the server.

The _Hypertext Transfer Protocol_, already mentioned in [Chapter
?](browser#web), is the mechanism through which data is requested and
provided on the ((World Wide Web)). This chapter describes the
((protocol)) in more detail and explains the way ((browser))
JavaScript has access to it.

## The protocol

{{index "IP address"}}

If you type _eloquentjavascript.net/18_http.html_ into your browser's
((address bar)), the ((browser)) first looks up the ((address)) of the
server associated with _eloquentjavascript.net_ and tries to open a
((TCP)) ((connection)) to it on ((port)) 80, the default port for
((HTTP)) traffic. If the ((server)) exists and accepts the connection,
the browser might send something like this:

```{lang: http}
GET /18_http.html HTTP/1.1
Host: eloquentjavascript.net
User-Agent: Your browser's name
```

Then the server responds, through that same connection.

```{lang: http}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 65585
Content-Type: text/html
Last-Modified: Mon, 08 Jan 2018 10:29:45 GMT

<!doctype html>
... the rest of the document
```

The browser takes the part of the ((response)) after the blank line,
its _body_ (not to be confused with the HTML `<body>` tag), and
displays it as an ((HTML)) document.

{{index HTTP}}

The information sent by the client is called the _((request))_. It
starts with this line:

```{lang: http}
GET /18_http.html HTTP/1.1
```

{{index "DELETE method", "PUT method", "GET method"}}

The first word is the _((method))_ of the ((request)). `GET` means
that we want to _get_ the specified resource. Other common methods are
`DELETE` to delete a resource, `PUT` to create or replace it, and `POST` to send
information to it. Note that the ((server)) is not obliged to carry
out every request it gets. If you walk up to a random website and tell
it to `DELETE` its main page, it'll probably refuse.

{{index [path, URL], GitHub}}

The part after the ((method)) name is the path of the _((resource))_ the
request applies to. In the simplest case, a resource is simply a
((file)) on the ((server)), but the protocol doesn't require it to be.
A resource may be anything that can be transferred _as if_ it is a
file. Many servers generate the responses they produce on the fly. For
example, if you open
[_https://github.com/marijnh_](https://github.com/marijnh), the server looks
in its database for a user named "marijnh", and if it finds one, it
will generate a profile page for that user.

After the resource path, the first line of the request mentions
`HTTP/1.1` to indicate the ((version)) of the ((HTTP)) ((protocol)) it
is using.

In practice, many sites use HTTP version 2, which supports the same
concepts as version 1.1 but is a lot more complicated so that it can
be faster. Browsers will automatically switch to the appropriate
protocol version when talking to a given server, and the outcome of a
request is the same regardless of which version is used. Because version
1.1 is more straightforward and easier to play around with, we'll
focus on that.

{{index "status code"}}

The server's ((response)) will start with a version as well, followed
by the status of the response, first as a three-digit status code and
then as a human-readable string.

```{lang: http}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

{{index "200 (HTTP status code)", "error response", "404 (HTTP status code)"}}

Status codes starting with a 2 indicate that the request succeeded.
Codes starting with 4 mean there was something wrong with the
((request)). 404 is probably the most famous HTTP status code—it means
that the resource could not be found. Codes that start with 5 mean an
error happened on the ((server)) and the request is not to blame.

{{index HTTP}}

{{id headers}}

The first line of a request or response may be followed by any number
of _((header))s_. These are lines in the form `name: value` that
specify extra information about the request or response. These headers
were part of the example ((response)):

```{lang: null}
Content-Length: 65585
Content-Type: text/html
Last-Modified: Thu, 04 Jan 2018 14:05:30 GMT
```

{{index "Content-Length header", "Content-Type header", "Last-Modified header"}}

This tells us the size and type of the response document. In this
case, it is an HTML document of 65,585 bytes. It also tells us when
that document was last modified.

{{index "Host header", domain}}

For most ((header))s, the client and server are free to decide whether
to include them in a ((request)) or ((response)). But a few are
required. For example, the `Host` header, which specifies the
hostname, should be included in a request because a ((server)) might
be serving multiple hostnames on a single ((IP address)), and without
that header, the server won't know which hostname the client is trying
to talk to.

{{index "GET method", "DELETE method", "PUT method", "POST method", "body (HTTP)"}}

After the headers, both requests and responses may include a blank
line followed by a body, which contains the data being sent. `GET` and
`DELETE` requests don't send along any data, but `PUT` and `POST`
requests do. Similarly, some response types, such as error responses,
do not require a body.

## Browsers and HTTP

{{index HTTP}}

As we saw in the example, a ((browser)) will make a request when we
enter a ((URL)) in its ((address bar)). When the resulting HTML page
references other files, such as ((image))s and JavaScript ((file))s,
those are also retrieved.

{{index parallelism, "GET method"}}

A moderately complicated ((website)) can easily include anywhere from
10 to 200 ((resource))s. To be able to fetch those quickly, browsers
will make several `GET` requests simultaneously, rather than waiting
for the responses one at a time.

HTML pages may include _((form))s_, which allow the user to fill out
information and send it to the server. This is an example of a form:

```{lang: "text/html"}
<form method="GET" action="example/message.html">
  <p>Name: <input type="text" name="name"></p>
  <p>Message:<br><textarea name="message"></textarea></p>
  <p><button type="submit">Send</button></p>
</form>
```

{{index form, "method attribute", "GET method"}}

This code describes a form with two ((field))s: a small one asking for
a name and a larger one to write a message in. When you click the Send
((button)), the form is _submitted_, meaning that the content of its
field is packed into an HTTP request and the browser navigates to the
result of that request.

When the `<form>` element's `method` attribute is `GET` (or is
omitted), the information in the form is added to the end of the
`action` URL as a _((query string))_. The browser might make a request
to this URL:

```{lang: null}
GET /example/message.html?name=Jean&message=Yes%3F HTTP/1.1
```

{{index "ampersand character"}}

The ((question mark)) indicates the end of the path part of the URL
and the start of the query. It is followed by pairs of names and
values, corresponding to the `name` attribute on the form field
elements and the content of those elements, respectively. An ampersand
character (`&`) is used to separate the pairs.

{{index [escaping, "in URLs"], "hexadecimal number", "encodeURIComponent function", "decodeURIComponent function"}}

The actual message encoded in the URL is "Yes?", but the question mark
is replaced by a strange code. Some characters in query strings must
be escaped. The question mark, represented as `%3F`, is one of those.
There seems to be an unwritten rule that every format needs its own
way of escaping characters. This one, called _((URL encoding))_, uses
a ((percent sign)) followed by two hexadecimal (base 16) digits that
encode the character code. In this case, 3F, which is 63 in decimal
notation, is the code of a question mark character. JavaScript
provides the `encodeURIComponent` and `decodeURIComponent` functions
to encode and decode this format.

```
console.log(encodeURIComponent("Yes?"));
// → Yes%3F
console.log(decodeURIComponent("Yes%3F"));
// → Yes?
```

{{index "body (HTTP)", "POST method"}}

If we change the `method` attribute of the HTML form in the example we
saw earlier to `POST`, the ((HTTP)) request made to submit the
((form)) will use the `POST` method and put the ((query string)) in
the body of the request, rather than adding it to the URL.

```{lang: http}
POST /example/message.html HTTP/1.1
Content-length: 24
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=Jean&message=Yes%3F
```

`GET` requests should be used for requests that do not have ((side
effect))s but simply ask for information. Requests that change
something on the server, for example creating a new account or posting
a message, should be expressed with other methods, such as `POST`.
Client-side software such as a browser knows that it shouldn't blindly
make `POST` requests but will often implicitly make `GET` requests—for
example to prefetch a resource it believes the user will soon need.

We'll come back to forms and how to interact with them from JavaScript
[later in the chapter](http#forms).

{{id fetch}}

## Fetch

{{index "fetch function", "Promise class"}}

The ((interface)) through which browser JavaScript can make HTTP
requests is called `fetch`. Since it is relatively new, it
conveniently uses promises (which is rare for browser interfaces).

```{test: no}
fetch("example/data.txt").then(response => {
  console.log(response.status);
  // → 200
  console.log(response.headers.get("Content-Type"));
  // → text/plain
});
```

{{index "Response class", "status property", "headers property"}}

Calling `fetch` returns a promise that resolves to a `Response` object
holding information about the server's response, such as its status
code and its headers. The headers are wrapped in a `Map`-like object
that treats its keys (the header names) as case insensitive because
header names are not supposed to be case sensitive. This means 
`headers.get("Content-Type")` and `headers.get("content-TYPE")` will
return the same value.

Note that the promise returned by `fetch` resolves successfully even
if the server responded with an error code. It _might_ also be
rejected if there is a network error or if the ((server)) that the
request is addressed to can't be found.

{{index [path, URL], "relative URL"}}

The first argument to `fetch` is the URL that should be requested.
When that ((URL)) doesn't start with a protocol name (such as _http:_),
it is treated as _relative_, which means it is interpreted relative
to the current document. When it starts with a slash (/), it replaces
the current path, which is the part after the server name. When it
does not, the part of the current path up to and including its last
((slash character)) is put in front of the relative URL.

{{index "text method", "body (HTTP)", "Promise class"}}

To get at the actual content of a response, you can use its `text`
method. Because the initial promise is resolved as soon as the
response's headers have been received and because reading the response body
might take a while longer, this again returns a promise.

```{test: no}
fetch("example/data.txt")
  .then(resp => resp.text())
  .then(text => console.log(text));
// → This is the content of data.txt
```

{{index "json method"}}

A similar method, called `json`, returns a promise that
resolves to the value you get when parsing the body as ((JSON)) or
rejects if it's not valid JSON.

{{index "GET method", "body (HTTP)", "DELETE method", "method property"}}

By default, `fetch` uses the `GET` method to make its request and
does not include a request body. You can configure it differently by
passing an object with extra options as a second argument. For
example, this request tries to delete `example/data.txt`:

```{test: no}
fetch("example/data.txt", {method: "DELETE"}).then(resp => {
  console.log(resp.status);
  // → 405
});
```

{{index "405 (HTTP status code)"}}

The 405 status code means "method not allowed", an HTTP server's way
of saying "I can't do that".

{{index "Range header", "body property", "headers property"}}

To add a request body, you can include a `body` option. To set
headers, there's the `headers` option. For example, this request
includes a `Range` header, which instructs the server to return only
part of a response.

```{test: no}
fetch("example/data.txt", {headers: {Range: "bytes=8-19"}})
  .then(resp => resp.text())
  .then(console.log);
// → the content
```

The browser will automatically add some request ((header))s, such as
"Host" and those needed for the server to figure out the size of the
body. But adding your own headers is often useful to include things
such as authentication information or to tell the server which file
format you'd like to receive.

{{id http_sandbox}}

## HTTP sandboxing

{{index sandbox}}

Making ((HTTP)) requests in web page scripts once again raises
concerns about ((security)). The person who controls the script might
not have the same interests as the person on whose computer it is
running. More specifically, if I visit _themafia.org_, I do not want
its scripts to be able to make a request to _mybank.com_, using
identifying information from my ((browser)), with instructions to
transfer all my money to some random account.

For this reason, browsers protect us by disallowing scripts to make
HTTP requests to other ((domain))s (names such as _themafia.org_ and
_mybank.com_).

{{index "Access-Control-Allow-Origin header", "cross-domain request"}}

This can be an annoying problem when building systems that want to
access several domains for legitimate reasons. Fortunately,
((server))s can include a ((header)) like this in their ((response))
to explicitly indicate to the browser that it is okay for the request
to come from another domain:

```{lang: null}
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

## Appreciating HTTP

{{index client, HTTP}}

When building a system that requires ((communication)) between a
JavaScript program running in the ((browser)) (client-side) and a
program on a ((server)) (server-side), there are several different
ways to model this communication.

{{index network, abstraction}}

A commonly used model is that of _((remote procedure call))s_. In this
model, communication follows the patterns of normal function calls,
except that the function is actually running on another machine.
Calling it involves making a request to the server that includes the
function's name and arguments. The response to that request contains
the returned value.

When thinking in terms of remote procedure calls, HTTP is just a
vehicle for communication, and you will most likely write an
abstraction layer that hides it entirely.

{{index "media type", "document format"}}

Another approach is to build your communication around the concept of
((resource))s and ((HTTP)) ((method))s. Instead of a remote procedure
called `addUser`, you use a `PUT` request to `/users/larry`. Instead
of encoding that user's properties in function arguments, you define a
JSON document format (or use an existing format) that represents a
user. The body of the `PUT` request to create a new resource is then
such a document. A resource is fetched by making a `GET` request to
the resource's URL (for example, `/user/larry`), which again returns
the document representing the resource.

This second approach makes it easier to use some of the features that
HTTP provides, such as support for caching resources (keeping a copy
on the client for fast access). The concepts used in HTTP, which are
well designed, can provide a helpful set of principles to design your
server interface around.

## Security and HTTPS

{{index "man-in-the-middle", security, HTTPS}}

Data traveling over the Internet tends to follow a long, dangerous
road. To get to its destination, it must hop through anything from
coffee shop Wi-Fi hotspots to ((network))s controlled by various companies and
states. At any point along its route it may be inspected or even
modified.

{{index tampering}}

If it is important that something remain secret, such as the
((password)) to your ((email)) account, or that it arrive at its
destination unmodified, such as the account number you transfer money
to via your bank's website, plain HTTP is not good enough.

{{index cryptography, encryption}}

{{indexsee "Secure HTTP", HTTPS}}

The secure ((HTTP)) protocol, used for ((URL))s starting with _https://_,
wraps HTTP traffic in a way that makes it harder to read and tamper
with. Before exchanging data, the client verifies that the server is
who it claims to be by asking it to prove that it has a cryptographic
((certificate)) issued by a certificate authority that the ((browser))
recognizes. Next, all data going over the ((connection)) is encrypted
in a way that should prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

Thus, when it works right, ((HTTPS)) prevents other people from
impersonating the website you are trying to talk to and from
snooping on your communication. It is not perfect, and there have been
various incidents where HTTPS failed because of forged or stolen
certificates and broken software, but it is a _lot_ safer than plain
HTTP.

{{id forms}}

## Form fields

Forms were originally designed for the pre-JavaScript Web to allow
web sites to send user-submitted information in an HTTP request. This
design assumes that interaction with the server always happens by
navigating to a new page.

But their elements are part of the ((DOM)) like the rest of the page,
and the DOM elements that represent form ((field))s support a number
of properties and events that are not present on other elements. These
make it possible to inspect and control such input fields with
JavaScript programs and do things such as adding new functionality to
a form or using forms and fields as building blocks in a JavaScript
application.

{{index "form (HTML tag)"}}

A web form consists of any number of input ((field))s grouped in a
`<form>` tag. HTML allows several different styles of fields, ranging
from simple on/off checkboxes to drop-down menus and fields for text
input. This book won't try to comprehensively discuss all field types,
but we'll start with a rough overview.

{{index "input (HTML tag)", "type attribute"}}

A lot of field types use the
`<input>` tag. This tag's `type` attribute is used to select the
field's style. These are some commonly used `<input>` types:

{{index "password field", checkbox, "radio button", "file field"}}

{{table {cols: [1,5]}}}

| `text`     | A single-line ((text field))
| `password` | Same as `text` but hides the text that is typed
| `checkbox` | An on/off switch
| `radio`    | (Part of) a ((multiple-choice)) field
| `file`     | Allows the user to choose a file from their computer

{{index "value attribute", "checked attribute", "form (HTML tag)"}}

Form fields do not necessarily have to appear in a `<form>` tag. You
can put them anywhere in a page. Such form-less fields cannot be
((submit))ted (only a form as a whole can), but when responding to
input with JavaScript, we often don't want to submit our fields
normally anyway.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<p><input type="text" value="abc"> (text)</p>
<p><input type="password" value="abc"> (password)</p>
<p><input type="checkbox" checked> (checkbox)</p>
<p><input type="radio" value="A" name="choice">
   <input type="radio" value="B" name="choice" checked>
   <input type="radio" value="C" name="choice"> (radio)</p>
<p><input type="file"> (file)</p>
```

{{if book

The fields created with this HTML code look like this:

{{figure {url: "img/form_fields.png", alt: "Various types of input tags",width: "4cm"}}}

if}}

The JavaScript interface for such elements differs with the type of
the element.

{{index "textarea (HTML tag)", "text field"}}

Multiline text fields have their own tag, `<textarea>`, mostly because
using an attribute to specify a multiline starting value would be
awkward. The `<textarea>` tag requires a matching `</textarea>`
closing tag and uses the text between those two, instead of the
`value` attribute, as starting text.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<textarea>
one
two
three
</textarea>
```

{{index "select (HTML tag)", "option (HTML tag)", "multiple choice", "drop-down menu"}}

Finally, the `<select>` tag is used to
create a field that allows the user to select from a number of
predefined options.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<select>
  <option>Pancakes</option>
  <option>Pudding</option>
  <option>Ice cream</option>
</select>
```

{{if book

Such a field looks like this:

{{figure {url: "img/form_select.png", alt: "A select field", width: "4cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "change event"}}

Whenever the value of a form field changes, it will fire a `"change"`
event.

## Focus

{{index keyboard, focus}}

{{indexsee "keyboard focus", focus}}

Unlike most elements in HTML documents, form fields can get _keyboard
((focus))_. When clicked or activated in some other way, they become
the currently active element and the recipient of keyboard ((input)).

{{index "option (HTML tag)", "select (HTML tag)"}}

Thus, you can type into a ((text field)) only when it is focused. Other
fields respond differently to keyboard events. For example, a
`<select>` menu tries to move to the option that contains the text the
user typed and responds to the arrow keys by moving its selection up
and down.

{{index "focus method", "blur method", "activeElement property"}}

We can control ((focus)) from JavaScript with the `focus` and `blur`
methods. The first moves focus to the DOM element it is called on, and
the second removes focus. The value in `document.activeElement`
corresponds to the currently focused element.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<input type="text">
<script>
  document.querySelector("input").focus();
  console.log(document.activeElement.tagName);
  // → INPUT
  document.querySelector("input").blur();
  console.log(document.activeElement.tagName);
  // → BODY
</script>
```

{{index "autofocus attribute"}}

For some pages, the user is expected to want to interact with a form
field immediately. JavaScript can be used to ((focus)) this field when
the document is loaded, but HTML also provides the `autofocus`
attribute, which produces the same effect while letting the browser
know what we are trying to achieve. This gives the browser the option
to disable the behavior when it is not appropriate, such as when the
user has put the focus on something else.

{{index "tab key", keyboard, "tabindex attribute", "a (HTML tag)"}}

Browsers traditionally also allow the user to move the focus
through the document by pressing the [tab]{keyname} key. We can influence the
order in which elements receive focus with the `tabindex` attribute.
The following example document will let the focus jump from the text input to
the OK button, rather than going through the help link first:

```{lang: "text/html", focus: true}
<input type="text" tabindex=1> <a href=".">(help)</a>
<button onclick="console.log('ok')" tabindex=2>OK</button>
```

{{index "tabindex attribute"}}

By default, most types of HTML elements cannot be focused. But you can
add a `tabindex` attribute to any element that will make it
focusable. A `tabindex` of -1 makes tabbing skip over an element, even
if it is normally focusable.

## Disabled fields

{{index "disabled attribute"}}

All ((form)) ((field))s can be _disabled_ through their `disabled`
attribute. It is an ((attribute)) that can be specified without
value—the fact that it is present at all disables the element.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<button>I'm all right</button>
<button disabled>I'm out</button>
```

Disabled fields cannot be ((focus))ed or changed, and browsers make
them look gray and faded.

{{if book

{{figure {url: "img/button_disabled.png", alt: "A disabled button",width: "3cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "user experience", "asynchronous programming"}}

When a program is
in the process of handling an action caused by some ((button)) or other control
that might require communication with the server and thus take a
while, it can be a good idea to
disable the control until the action finishes. That way, when the user
gets impatient and clicks it again, they don't accidentally repeat
their action.

## The form as a whole

{{index "array-like object", "form (HTML tag)", "form property", "elements property"}}

When a ((field)) is contained in a `<form>` element, its DOM element
will have a `form` property linking back to the form's DOM element.
The `<form>` element, in turn, has a property called `elements` that
contains an array-like collection of the fields inside it.

{{index "elements property", "name attribute"}}

The `name` attribute of a form field determines the way its value will
be identified when the form is ((submit))ted. It can also be used as a
property name when accessing the form's `elements` property, which
acts both as an array-like object (accessible by number) and a ((map))
(accessible by name).

```{lang: "text/html"}
<form action="example/submit.html">
  Name: <input type="text" name="name"><br>
  Password: <input type="password" name="password"><br>
  <button type="submit">Log in</button>
</form>
<script>
  let form = document.querySelector("form");
  console.log(form.elements[1].type);
  // → password
  console.log(form.elements.password.type);
  // → password
  console.log(form.elements.name.form == form);
  // → true
</script>
```

{{index "button (HTML tag)", "type attribute", submit, "enter key"}}

A button with a `type` attribute of `submit` will, when pressed,
cause the form to be submitted. Pressing [enter]{keyname} when a form field is
focused has the same effect.

{{index "submit event", "event handling", "preventDefault method", "page reload", "GET method", "POST method"}}

Submitting a ((form)) normally means that the ((browser)) navigates to
the page indicated by the form's `action` attribute, using either a
`GET` or a `POST` ((request)). But before that happens, a `"submit"`
event is fired. You can handle this event with JavaScript and prevent
this default behavior by calling `preventDefault` on the event object.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<form action="example/submit.html">
  Value: <input type="text" name="value">
  <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
<script>
  let form = document.querySelector("form");
  form.addEventListener("submit", event => {
    console.log("Saving value", form.elements.value.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  });
</script>
```

{{index "submit event", validation, XMLHttpRequest}}

Intercepting `"submit"` events in JavaScript has various uses. We can
write code to verify that the values the user entered make sense and
immediately show an error message instead of submitting the form. Or
we can disable the regular way of submitting the form entirely, as in
the example, and have our program handle the input, possibly using
`fetch` to send it to a server without reloading the page.

## Text fields

{{index "value attribute", "input (HTML tag)", "text field", "textarea (HTML tag)"}}

Fields created by `<input>` tags with a type of `text` or `password`,
as well as `<textarea>` tags, share a common ((interface)). Their
((DOM)) elements have a `value` property that holds their current
content as a string value. Setting this property to another string
changes the field's content.

{{index "selectionStart property", "selectionEnd property"}}

The
`selectionStart` and `selectionEnd` properties of ((text field))s give
us information about the ((cursor)) and ((selection)) in the ((text)).
When nothing is selected, these two properties hold the same number,
indicating the position of the cursor. For example, 0 indicates the
start of the text, and 10 indicates the cursor is after the 10^th^ ((character)).
When part of the field is selected, the two properties will differ, giving us the
start and end of the selected text. Like `value`, these properties may
also be written to.

{{index Khasekhemwy, "textarea (HTML tag)", keyboard, "event handling"}}

Imagine you are writing an article about Khasekhemwy but have some
trouble spelling his name. The following code wires up a `<textarea>`
tag with an event handler that, when you press F2, inserts the string
"Khasekhemwy" for you.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<textarea></textarea>
<script>
  let textarea = document.querySelector("textarea");
  textarea.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
    // The key code for F2 happens to be 113
    if (event.keyCode == 113) {
      replaceSelection(textarea, "Khasekhemwy");
      event.preventDefault();
    }
  });
  function replaceSelection(field, word) {
    let from = field.selectionStart, to = field.selectionEnd;
    field.value = field.value.slice(0, from) + word +
                  field.value.slice(to);
    // Put the cursor after the word
    field.selectionStart = from + word.length;
    field.selectionEnd = from + word.length;
  }
</script>
```

{{index "replaceSelection function", "text field"}}

The `replaceSelection`
function replaces the currently selected part of a text field's
content with the given word and then moves the ((cursor)) after that
word so that the user can continue typing.

{{index "change event", "input event"}}

The `"change"` event for a ((text
field)) does not fire every time something is typed. Rather, it
fires when the field loses ((focus)) after its content was changed.
To respond immediately to changes in a text field, you should register
a handler for the `"input"` event instead, which fires for every
time the user types a character, deletes text, or otherwise manipulates
the field's content.

The following example shows a text field and a counter displaying the
current length of the text in the field:

```{lang: "text/html"}
<input type="text"> length: <span id="length">0</span>
<script>
  let text = document.querySelector("input");
  let output = document.querySelector("#length");
  text.addEventListener("input", () => {
    output.textContent = text.value.length;
  });
</script>
```

## Checkboxes and radio buttons

{{index "input (HTML tag)", "checked attribute"}}

A ((checkbox)) field is a binary toggle. Its value can be extracted or
changed through its `checked` property, which holds a Boolean value.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="purple"> Make this page purple
</label>
<script>
  let checkbox = document.querySelector("#purple");
  checkbox.addEventListener("change", () => {
    document.body.style.background =
      checkbox.checked ? "mediumpurple" : "";
  });
</script>
```

{{index "for attribute", "id attribute", focus, "label (HTML tag)", labeling}}

The `<label>` tag associates a piece of document with an input
((field)). Clicking anywhere on the label will activate the field,
which focuses it and toggles its value when it is a checkbox or radio
button.

{{index "input (HTML tag)", "multiple-choice"}}

A ((radio button)) is similar to a checkbox, but it's implicitly
linked to other radio buttons with the same `name` attribute so that
only one of them can be active at any time.

```{lang: "text/html"}
Color:
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="orange"> Orange
</label>
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="lightgreen"> Green
</label>
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="color" value="lightblue"> Blue
</label>
<script>
  let buttons = document.querySelectorAll("[name=color]");
  for (let button of Array.from(buttons)) {
    button.addEventListener("change", () => {
      document.body.style.background = button.value;
    });
  }
</script>
```

{{index "name attribute", "querySelectorAll method"}}

The ((square brackets)) in the CSS query given to `querySelectorAll`
are used to match attributes. It selects elements whose `name`
attribute is `"color"`.

## Select fields

{{index "select (HTML tag)", "multiple-choice", "option (HTML tag)"}}

Select fields are conceptually similar to radio buttons—they
also allow the user to choose from a set of options. But where a radio
button puts the layout of the options under our control, the
appearance of a `<select>` tag is determined by the browser.

{{index "multiple attribute", "drop-down menu"}}

Select fields also have a variant that is more akin to a list of
checkboxes, rather than radio boxes. When given the `multiple`
attribute, a `<select>` tag will allow the user to select any number
of options, rather than just a single option. This will, in most
browsers, show up differently than a normal select field, which is
typically drawn as a _drop-down_ control that shows the options only
when you open it.

{{index "option (HTML tag)", "value attribute"}}

Each `<option>` tag has a value. This value can be defined with a
`value` attribute. When that is not given, the ((text)) inside the
option will count as its value. The `value` property of a `<select>`
element reflects the currently selected option. For a `multiple`
field, though, this property doesn't mean much since it will give the
value of only _one_ of the currently selected options.

{{index "select (HTML tag)", "options property", "selected attribute"}}

The `<option>` tags for a `<select>` field can be accessed as an
array-like object through the field's `options` property. Each option
has a property called `selected`, which indicates whether that option
is currently selected. The property can also be written to select or
deselect an option.

{{index "multiple attribute", "binary number"}}

This example extracts the selected values from a `multiple` select
field and uses them to compose a binary number from individual bits.
Hold [control]{keyname} (or [command]{keyname} on a Mac) to select multiple options.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<select multiple>
  <option value="1">0001</option>
  <option value="2">0010</option>
  <option value="4">0100</option>
  <option value="8">1000</option>
</select> = <span id="output">0</span>
<script>
  let select = document.querySelector("select");
  let output = document.querySelector("#output");
  select.addEventListener("change", () => {
    let number = 0;
    for (let option of Array.from(select.options)) {
      if (option.selected) {
        number += Number(option.value);
      }
    }
    output.textContent = number;
  });
</script>
```

## File fields

{{index file, "hard drive", "file system", security, "file field", "input (HTML tag)"}}

File fields were originally designed as
a way to ((upload)) files from the browser's machine through a form.
In modern browsers, they also provide a way to read such files from
JavaScript programs. The field acts as a manner of gatekeeper. The
script cannot simply start reading private files from the user's
computer, but if the user selects a file in such a field, the browser
interprets that action to mean that the script may read the file.

A file field usually looks like a button labeled with something like
"choose file" or "browse", with information about the chosen file next
to it.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<input type="file">
<script>
  let input = document.querySelector("input");
  input.addEventListener("change", () => {
    if (input.files.length > 0) {
      let file = input.files[0];
      console.log("You chose", file.name);
      if (file.type) console.log("It has type", file.type);
    }
  });
</script>
```

{{index "multiple attribute", "files property"}}

The `files` property of a
((file field)) element is an ((array-like object)) (again, not a real
array) containing the files chosen in the field. It is initially
empty. The reason there isn't simply a `file` property is that file
fields also support a `multiple` attribute, which makes it possible to
select multiple files at the same time.

{{index "File type"}}

Objects in the `files` object have properties such as `name` (the
filename), `size` (the file's size in bytes, which are chunks of 8
bits), and `type` (the media type of the file, such as `text/plain` or
`image/jpeg`).

{{index "asynchronous programming", "file reading", "FileReader class"}}

{{id filereader}}

What it does not have is a property that contains the content of the
file. Getting at that is a little more involved. Since reading a file
from disk can take time, the interface must be asynchronous to avoid
freezing the document.

```{lang: "text/html"}
<input type="file" multiple>
<script>
  let input = document.querySelector("input");
  input.addEventListener("change", () => {
    for (let file of Array.from(input.files)) {
      let reader = new FileReader();
      reader.addEventListener("load", () => {
        console.log("File", file.name, "starts with",
                    reader.result.slice(0, 20));
      });
      reader.readAsText(file);
    }
  });
</script>
```

{{index "FileReader class", "load event", "readAsText method", "result property"}}

Reading a file is done by creating a `FileReader` object, registering
a `"load"` event handler for it, and calling its `readAsText` method,
giving it the file we want to read. Once loading finishes, the
reader's `result` property contains the file's content.

{{index "error event", "FileReader class", "Promise class"}}

`FileReader`s also fire an `"error"` event when reading the file fails
for any reason. The error object itself will end up in the reader's
`error` property. This interface was designed before promises became
part of the language. You could wrap it in a promise like this:

```
function readFileText(file) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let reader = new FileReader();
    reader.addEventListener(
      "load", () => resolve(reader.result));
    reader.addEventListener(
      "error", () => reject(reader.error));
    reader.readAsText(file);
  });
}
```

## Storing data client-side

{{index "web application"}}

Simple ((HTML)) pages with a bit of JavaScript can be a great format
for "((mini application))s"—small helper programs that automate basic
tasks. By connecting a few form ((field))s with event handlers, you
can do anything from converting between centimeters and inches to
computing passwords from a master password and a website name.

{{index persistence, memory}}

When such an application needs to remember something between sessions,
you cannot use JavaScript ((binding))s—those are thrown away every
time the page is closed. You could set up a server, connect it to the
Internet, and have your application store something there. We will see
how to do that in [Chapter ?](node). But that's a lot of extra work
and complexity. Sometimes it is enough to just keep the data in the
((browser)).

{{index "localStorage object", "setItem method", "getItem method", "removeItem method"}}

The `localStorage` object can be used to store data in a way that
survives ((page reload))s. This object allows you to file string
values under names.

```
localStorage.setItem("username", "marijn");
console.log(localStorage.getItem("username"));
// → marijn
localStorage.removeItem("username");
```

{{index "localStorage object"}}

A value in `localStorage` sticks around until it is overwritten, it is
removed with `removeItem`, or the user clears their local data.

{{index security}}

Sites from different ((domain))s get different storage
compartments. That means data stored in `localStorage` by a given
website can, in principle, be read (and overwritten) only by scripts on
that same site.

{{index "localStorage object"}}

Browsers do enforce a limit on the size of the data a site can store
in `localStorage`. That restriction, along with the fact that filling
up people's ((hard drive))s with junk is not really profitable,
prevents the feature from eating up too much space.

{{index "localStorage object", "note-taking example", "select (HTML tag)", "button (HTML tag)", "textarea (HTML tag)"}}

The following code implements a crude note-taking application. It
keeps a set of named notes and allows the user to edit notes and
create new ones.

```{lang: "text/html", startCode: true}
Notes: <select></select> <button>Add</button><br>
<textarea style="width: 100%"></textarea>

<script>
  let list = document.querySelector("select");
  let note = document.querySelector("textarea");

  let state;
  function setState(newState) {
    list.textContent = "";
    for (let name of Object.keys(newState.notes)) {
      let option = document.createElement("option");
      option.textContent = name;
      if (newState.selected == name) option.selected = true;
      list.appendChild(option);
    }
    note.value = newState.notes[newState.selected];

    localStorage.setItem("Notes", JSON.stringify(newState));
    state = newState;
  }
  setState(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("Notes")) || {
    notes: {"shopping list": "Carrots\nRaisins"},
    selected: "shopping list"
  });

  list.addEventListener("change", () => {
    setState({notes: state.notes, selected: list.value});
  });
  note.addEventListener("change", () => {
    setState({
      notes: Object.assign({}, state.notes,
                           {[state.selected]: note.value}),
      selected: state.selected
    });
  });
  document.querySelector("button")
    .addEventListener("click", () => {
      let name = prompt("Note name");
      if (name) setState({
        notes: Object.assign({}, state.notes, {[name]: ""}),
        selected: name
      });
    });
</script>
```

{{index "getItem method", JSON, "|| operator", "default value"}}

The script gets its starting state from the `"Notes"` value stored in
`localStorage` or, if that is missing, creates an example state
that has only a shopping list in it. Reading a field that does not
exist from `localStorage` will yield `null`. Passing `null` to
`JSON.parse` will make it parse the string `"null"` and return `null`.
Thus, the `||` operator can be used to provide a default value in a
situation like this.

The `setState` method makes sure the DOM is showing a given state and
stores the new state to `localStorage`. Event handlers call this
function to move to a new state.

{{index "Object.assign function", object, property, "computed property"}}

The use of `Object.assign` in the example is intended to create a new
object that is a clone of the old `state.notes`, but with one property
added or overwritten. `Object.assign` takes its first argument and
adds all properties from any further arguments to it. Thus, giving it
an empty object will cause it to fill a fresh object. The ((square
brackets)) notation in the third argument is used to create a property
whose name is based on some dynamic value.

{{index "sessionStorage object"}}

There is another object, similar to `localStorage`, called
`sessionStorage`. The difference between the two is that the content
of `sessionStorage` is forgotten at the end of each _((session))_,
which for most ((browser))s means whenever the browser is closed.

## Summary

In this chapter, we discussed how the HTTP protocol works. A _client_
sends a request, which contains a method (usually `GET`) and a path
that identifies a resource. The _server_ then decides what to do with
the request and responds with a status code and a response body. Both
requests and responses may contain headers that provide additional
information.

The interface through which browser JavaScript can make HTTP requests
is called `fetch`. Making a request looks like this:

```
fetch("/18_http.html").then(r => r.text()).then(text => {
  console.log(`The page starts with ${text.slice(0, 15)}`);
});
```

Browsers make `GET` requests to fetch the resources needed to display
a web page. A page may also contain forms, which allow information
entered by the user to be sent as a request for a new page when the
form is submitted.

HTML can represent various types of form fields, such as text fields,
checkboxes, multiple-choice fields, and file pickers.

Such fields can be inspected and manipulated with JavaScript. They
fire the `"change"` event when changed, fire the `"input"` event when text
is typed, and receive keyboard events when they have keyboard focus.
Properties like `value` (for text and select fields) or `checked` (for
checkboxes and radio buttons) are used to read or set the field's
content.

When a form is submitted, a `"submit"` event is fired on it. A
JavaScript handler can call `preventDefault` on that event to disable
the browser's default behavior. Form field elements may also occur
outside of a form tag.

When the user has selected a file from their local file system in a
file picker field, the `FileReader` interface can be used to access
the content of this file from a JavaScript program.

The `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` objects can be used to save
information in a way that survives page reloads. The first object saves the
data forever (or until the user decides to clear it), and the second
saves it until the browser is closed.

## Exercises

### Content negotiation

{{index "Accept header", "media type", "document format", "content negotiation (exercise)"}}

One of the things HTTP can do is called _content negotiation_.
The `Accept` request header is used to tell the server what type of
document the client would like to get. Many servers ignore this
header, but when a server knows of various ways to encode a resource,
it can look at this header and send the one that the client prefers.

{{index "MIME type"}}

The URL
[_http://eloquentjavascript.net/author_](http://eloquentjavascript.net/author)
is configured to respond with either plaintext, HTML, or JSON,
depending on what the client asks for. These formats are identified by
the standardized _((media type))s_ `text/plain`, `text/html`, and
`application/json`.

{{index "headers property", "fetch function"}}

Send requests to fetch all three formats of this resource. Use the
`headers` property in the options object passed to `fetch` to set the
header named `Accept` to the desired media type.

Finally, try asking for the media type `application/rainbows+unicorns`
and see which status code that produces.

{{if interactive

```{test: no}
// Your code here.
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "content negotiation (exercise)"}}

Base your code on the `fetch` examples [earlier in the
chapter](http#fetch).

{{index "406 (HTTP status code)", "Accept header"}}

Asking for a bogus media type will return a response with code 406,
"Not acceptable", which is the code a server should return when it
can't fulfill the `Accept` header.

hint}}

### A JavaScript workbench

{{index "JavaScript console", "workbench (exercise)"}}

Build an interface that allows people to type and run pieces of
JavaScript code.

{{index "textarea (HTML tag)", "button (HTML tag)", "Function constructor", "error message"}}

Put a button next to a `<textarea>` field that, when pressed, uses
the `Function` constructor we saw in [Chapter ?](modules#eval) to wrap
the text in a function and call it. Convert the return value of the
function, or any error it raises, to a string and display it below the
text field.

{{if interactive

```{lang: "text/html", test: no}
<textarea id="code">return "hi";</textarea>
<button id="button">Run</button>
<pre id="output"></pre>

<script>
  // Your code here.
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "click event", "mousedown event", "Function constructor", "workbench (exercise)"}}

Use `document.querySelector` or `document.getElementById` to get
access to the elements defined in your HTML. An event handler for
`"click"` or `"mousedown"` events on the button can get the `value`
property of the text field and call `Function` on it.

{{index "try keyword", "exception handling"}}

Make sure you wrap both the call to `Function` and the call to its
result in a `try` block so you can catch the exceptions it
produces. In this case, we really don't know what type of exception we
are looking for, so catch everything.

{{index "textContent property", output, text, "createTextNode method", "newline character"}}

The `textContent` property of the output element can be used to fill
it with a string message. Or, if you want to keep the old content
around, create a new text node using `document.createTextNode` and
append it to the element. Remember to add a newline character to the
end so that not all output appears on a single line.

hint}}

### Conway's Game of Life

{{index "game of life (exercise)", "artificial life", "Conway's Game of Life"}}

Conway's Game of Life is a simple ((simulation)) that creates
artificial "life" on a ((grid)), each cell of which is either alive or
not. Each ((generation)) (turn), the following rules are applied:

* Any live ((cell)) with fewer than two or more than three live
  ((neighbor))s dies.

* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
  generation.

* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

A _neighbor_ is defined as any adjacent cell, including diagonally
adjacent ones.

{{index "pure function"}}

Note that these rules are applied to the whole grid at once, not one
square at a time. That means the counting of neighbors is based on the
situation at the start of the generation, and changes happening to
neighbor cells during this generation should not influence the new
state of a given cell.

{{index "Math.random function"}}

Implement this game using whichever ((data structure)) you find
appropriate. Use `Math.random` to populate the grid with a random
pattern initially. Display it as a grid of ((checkbox)) ((field))s,
with a ((button)) next to it to advance to the next ((generation)).
When the user checks or unchecks the checkboxes, their changes should
be included when computing the next generation.

{{if interactive

```{lang: "text/html", test: no}
<div id="grid"></div>
<button id="next">Next generation</button>

<script>
  // Your code here.
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "game of life (exercise)"}}

To solve the problem of having the changes conceptually happen at the
same time, try to see the computation of a ((generation)) as a ((pure
function)), which takes one ((grid)) and produces a new grid that
represents the next turn.

Representing the matrix can be done in the way shown in [Chapter
?](object#matrix). You can count live ((neighbor))s with two nested
loops, looping over adjacent coordinates in both dimensions. Take care
not to count cells outside of the field and to ignore the cell in the
center, whose neighbors we are counting.

{{index "event handling", "change event"}}

Ensuring that changes to ((checkbox))es take effect on the next generation
can be done in two ways. An event handler could notice these changes
and update the current grid to reflect them, or you could generate a
fresh grid from the values in the checkboxes before computing the next
turn.

If you choose to go with event handlers, you might want to attach
((attribute))s that identify the position that each checkbox
corresponds to so that it is easy to find out which cell to change.

{{index drawing, "table (HTML tag)", "br (HTML tag)"}}

To draw the grid of checkboxes, you can either use a `<table>` element
(see [Chapter ?](dom#exercise_table)) or simply put them all in the
same element and put `<br>` (line break) elements between the rows.

hint}}
