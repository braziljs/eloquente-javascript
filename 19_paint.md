# Project: A Pixel Art Editor

{{quote {author: "Joan Miro", chapter: true}

I look at the many colors before me. I look at my blank canvas. Then,
I try to apply colors like words that shape poems, like notes that
shape music.

{{figure {url: "img/chapter_picture_19.jpg", alt: "Picture of a tiled mosaic", chapter: "framed"}}}

The material from the previous chapters gives you all the elements you
need to build a basic ((web application)). In this chapter, we will do
just that.

Our ((application)) will be a ((pixel)) ((drawing)) program, where you
can modify a picture pixel by pixel by manipulating a zoomed-in view of it, shown as a grid of colored squares. You can use the program to open image ((file))s,
scribble on them with your mouse or other pointer device, and save
them. This is what it will look like:

{{figure {url: "img/pixel_editor.png", alt: "The pixel editor interface, with colored pixels at the top and a number of controls below that", width: "8cm"}}}

Painting on a computer is great. You don't need to worry about
materials, ((skill)), or talent. You just start smearing.

## Components

{{index drawing, "select (HTML tag)", "canvas (HTML tag)", component}}

The interface for the application shows a big `<canvas>` element on
top, with a number of form ((field))s below it. The user draws on the
((picture)) by selecting a tool from a `<select>` field and then
clicking, ((touch))ing, or ((dragging)) across the canvas. There are
((tool))s for drawing single pixels or rectangles, for filling an
area, and for picking a ((color)) from the picture.

We will structure the editor interface as a number of
_((component))s_, objects that are responsible for a piece of the
((DOM)) and that may contain other components inside them.

The ((state)) of the application consists of the current picture, the
selected tool, and the selected color. We'll set things up so that the
state lives in a single value, and the interface components always
base the way they look on the current state.

To see why this is important, let's consider the
alternative—distributing pieces of state throughout the interface. Up
to a certain point, this is easier to program. We can just put in a
((color field)) and read its value when we need to know the current
color.

But then we add the ((color picker))—a tool that lets you click the
picture to select the color of a given pixel. To keep the
color field showing the correct color, that tool would have to know
that it exists and update it whenever it picks a new color. If
you ever add another place that makes the color visible (maybe the
mouse cursor could show it), you have to update your
color-changing code to keep that synchronized.

{{index modularity}}

In effect, this creates a problem where each part of the interface
needs to know about all other parts, which is not very modular. For
small applications like the one in this chapter, that may not be a
problem. For bigger projects, it can turn into a real nightmare.

To avoid this nightmare on principle, we're going to be strict
about _((data flow))_. There is a state, and the interface is drawn
based on that state. An interface component may respond to user
actions by updating the state, at which point the components get a
chance to synchronize themselves with this new state.

{{index library, framework}}

In practice, each ((component)) is set up so that when it is given a
new state, it also notifies its child components, insofar as those
need to be updated. Setting this up is a bit of a hassle. Making this
more convenient is the main selling point of many browser programming
libraries. But for a small application like this, we can do it without
such infrastructure.

Updates to the ((state)) are represented as objects, which we'll call
_((action))s_. Components may create such actions and _((dispatch))_
them—give them to a central state management function. That function
computes the next state, after which the interface components update
themselves to this new state.

We're taking the messy task of running a ((user interface)) and
applying some ((structure)) to it. Though the ((DOM))-related pieces
are still full of ((side effect))s, they are held up by a conceptually
simple backbone: the state update cycle. The state determines what the
DOM looks like, and the only way DOM events can change the state is by
dispatching actions to the state.

{{index "data flow"}}

There are _many_ variants of this approach, each with its own
benefits and problems, but their central idea is the same: state
changes should go through a single well-defined channel, not happen
all over the place.

{{index "dom property"}}

Our ((component))s will be ((class))es conforming to an ((interface)).
Their constructor is given a state—which may be the whole application
state or some smaller value if it doesn't need access to everything—and
uses that to build up a `dom` property. This is the DOM element that represents
the component. Most constructors will also take some other values
that won't change over time, such as the function they can use to
((dispatch)) an action.

{{index "syncState method"}}

Each component has a `syncState` method that is used to synchronize it
to a new state value. The method takes one argument, the state, which
is of the same type as the first argument to its constructor.

## The state

{{index "Picture class", "picture property", "tool property", "color property", "Matrix class"}}

The application state will be an object with `picture`, `tool`, and
`color` properties. The picture is itself an object that stores the
width, height, and pixel content of the picture. The ((pixel))s are
stored in an array, in the same way as the matrix class from [Chapter
?](object)—row by row, from top to bottom.

```{includeCode: true}
class Picture {
  constructor(width, height, pixels) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.pixels = pixels;
  }
  static empty(width, height, color) {
    let pixels = new Array(width * height).fill(color);
    return new Picture(width, height, pixels);
  }
  pixel(x, y) {
    return this.pixels[x + y * this.width];
  }
  draw(pixels) {
    let copy = this.pixels.slice();
    for (let {x, y, color} of pixels) {
      copy[x + y * this.width] = color;
    }
    return new Picture(this.width, this.height, copy);
  }
}
```

{{index "side effect", "persistent data structure"}}

We want to be able to treat a picture as an ((immutable)) value, for
reasons that we'll get back to later in the chapter. But we also
sometimes need to update a whole bunch of pixels at a time. To be able
to do that, the class has a `draw` method that expects an array of
updated pixels—objects with `x`, `y`, and `color` properties—and
creates a new picture with those pixels overwritten. This method uses
`slice` without arguments to copy the entire pixel array—the start of
the slice defaults to 0, and the end defaults to the array's length.

{{index "Array constructor", "fill method", ["length property", "for array"]}}

The `empty` method uses two pieces of ((array)) functionality that we
haven't seen before. The `Array` constructor can be called with a
number to create an empty array of the given length. The `fill`
method can then be used to fill this array with a given value. These
are used to create an array in which all pixels have the same color.

{{index "hexadecimal number", "color component", "color field", "fillColor property"}}

Colors are stored as strings containing traditional ((CSS)) ((color
code))s made up of a ((hash sign)) (`#`) followed by six hexadecimal (base-16)
digits—two for the ((red)) component, two for the ((green))
component, and two for the ((blue)) component. This is a somewhat
cryptic and inconvenient way to write colors, but it is the format the
HTML color input field uses, and it can be used in the `fillColor`
property of a canvas drawing context, so for the ways we'll use colors
in this program, it is practical enough.

{{index black}}

Black, where all components are zero, is written `"#000000"`, and
bright ((pink)) looks like `"#ff00ff"`, where the red and blue
components have the maximum value of 255, written `ff` in hexadecimal
((digit))s (which use _a_ to _f_ to represent digits 10 to 15).

We'll allow the interface to ((dispatch)) ((action))s as objects whose
properties overwrite the properties of the previous ((state)). The
color field, when the user changes it, could dispatch an object like
`{color: field.value}`, from which this update function can compute a
new state.

{{index "updateState function"}}

```{includeCode: true}
function updateState(state, action) {
  return Object.assign({}, state, action);
}
```

{{index "period character", spread, "Object.assign function"}}

This rather cumbersome pattern, in which `Object.assign` is used to
first add the properties of `state` to an empty object and then
overwrite some of those with the properties from `action`, is common
in JavaScript code that uses ((immutable)) objects. A more convenient
notation for this, in which the triple-dot operator is used to include
all properties from another object in an object expression, is in the
final stages of being standardized. With that addition, you could
write `{...state, ...action}` instead. At the time of writing, this
doesn't yet work in all browsers.

## DOM building

{{index "createElement method", "elt function"}}

One of the main things that interface components do is creating
((DOM)) structure. We again don't want to directly use the verbose DOM
methods for that, so here's a slightly expanded version of the `elt`
function:

```{includeCode: true}
function elt(type, props, ...children) {
  let dom = document.createElement(type);
  if (props) Object.assign(dom, props);
  for (let child of children) {
    if (typeof child != "string") dom.appendChild(child);
    else dom.appendChild(document.createTextNode(child));
  }
  return dom;
}
```

{{index "setAttribute method", "attribute", "onclick property", "click event", "event handling"}}

The main difference between this version and the one we used in
[Chapter ?](game#domdisplay) is that it assigns _properties_ to DOM
nodes, not _attributes_. This means we can't use it to set arbitrary
attributes, but we _can_ use it to set properties whose value isn't a
string, such as `onclick`, which can be set to a function to register
a click event handler.

{{index "button (HTML tag)"}}

This allows the following style of registering event handlers:

```{lang: "text/html"}
<body>
  <script>
    document.body.appendChild(elt("button", {
      onclick: () => console.log("click")
    }, "The button"));
  </script>
</body>
```

## The canvas

The first component we'll define is the part of the interface that
displays the picture as a grid of colored boxes. This component is
responsible for two things: showing a picture and communicating
((pointer event))s on that picture to the rest of the application.

{{index "PictureCanvas class", "callback function", "scale constant", "canvas (HTML tag)", "mousedown event", "touchstart event"}}

As such, we can define it as a component that knows about only the
current picture, not the whole application ((state)). Because it
doesn't know how the application as a whole works, it cannot directly
dispatch ((action))s. Rather, when responding to pointer events, it
calls a callback function provided by the code that created it, which
will handle the application-specific parts.

```{includeCode: true}
const scale = 10;

class PictureCanvas {
  constructor(picture, pointerDown) {
    this.dom = elt("canvas", {
      onmousedown: event => this.mouse(event, pointerDown),
      ontouchstart: event => this.touch(event, pointerDown)
    });
    this.syncState(picture);
  }
  syncState(picture) {
    if (this.picture == picture) return;
    this.picture = picture;
    drawPicture(this.picture, this.dom, scale);
  }
}
```

{{index "syncState method", efficiency}}

We draw each pixel as a 10-by-10 square, as determined by the `scale`
constant. To avoid unnecessary work, the component keeps track of its
current picture and does a redraw only when `syncState` is given a new
picture.

{{index "drawPicture function"}}

The actual drawing function sets the size of the canvas based on the
scale and picture size and fills it with a series of squares, one for
each pixel.

```{includeCode: true}
function drawPicture(picture, canvas, scale) {
  canvas.width = picture.width * scale;
  canvas.height = picture.height * scale;
  let cx = canvas.getContext("2d");

  for (let y = 0; y < picture.height; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < picture.width; x++) {
      cx.fillStyle = picture.pixel(x, y);
      cx.fillRect(x * scale, y * scale, scale, scale);
    }
  }
}
```

{{index "mousedown event", "mousemove event", "button property", "buttons property", "pointerPosition function"}}

When the left mouse button is pressed while the mouse is over the
picture canvas, the component calls the `pointerDown` callback, giving
it the position of the pixel that was clicked—in picture coordinates.
This will be used to implement mouse interaction with the picture. The
callback may return another callback function to be notified when the
pointer is moved to a different pixel while the button is held down.

```{includeCode: true}
PictureCanvas.prototype.mouse = function(downEvent, onDown) {
  if (downEvent.button != 0) return;
  let pos = pointerPosition(downEvent, this.dom);
  let onMove = onDown(pos);
  if (!onMove) return;
  let move = moveEvent => {
    if (moveEvent.buttons == 0) {
      this.dom.removeEventListener("mousemove", move);
    } else {
      let newPos = pointerPosition(moveEvent, this.dom);
      if (newPos.x == pos.x && newPos.y == pos.y) return;
      pos = newPos;
      onMove(newPos);
    }
  };
  this.dom.addEventListener("mousemove", move);
};

function pointerPosition(pos, domNode) {
  let rect = domNode.getBoundingClientRect();
  return {x: Math.floor((pos.clientX - rect.left) / scale),
          y: Math.floor((pos.clientY - rect.top) / scale)};
}
```

{{index "getBoundingClientRect method", "clientX property", "clientY property"}}

Since we know the size of the ((pixel))s and we can use
`getBoundingClientRect` to find the position of the canvas on the
screen, it is possible to go from mouse event coordinates (`clientX`
and `clientY`) to picture coordinates. These are always rounded down
so that they refer to a specific pixel.

{{index "touchstart event", "touchmove event", "preventDefault method"}}

With touch events, we have to do something similar, but using
different events and making sure we call `preventDefault` on the
`"touchstart"` event to prevent ((panning)).

```{includeCode: true}
PictureCanvas.prototype.touch = function(startEvent,
                                         onDown) {
  let pos = pointerPosition(startEvent.touches[0], this.dom);
  let onMove = onDown(pos);
  startEvent.preventDefault();
  if (!onMove) return;
  let move = moveEvent => {
    let newPos = pointerPosition(moveEvent.touches[0],
                                 this.dom);
    if (newPos.x == pos.x && newPos.y == pos.y) return;
    pos = newPos;
    onMove(newPos);
  };
  let end = () => {
    this.dom.removeEventListener("touchmove", move);
    this.dom.removeEventListener("touchend", end);
  };
  this.dom.addEventListener("touchmove", move);
  this.dom.addEventListener("touchend", end);
};
```

{{index "touches property", "clientX property", "clientY property"}}

For touch events, `clientX` and `clientY` aren't available directly on
the event object, but we can use the coordinates of the first touch
object in the `touches` property.

## The application

To make it possible to build the application piece by piece, we'll
implement the main component as a shell around a picture canvas and a
dynamic set of ((tool))s and ((control))s that we pass to its
constructor.

The _controls_ are the interface elements that appear below the
picture. They'll be provided as an array of ((component))
constructors.

{{index "br (HTML tag)", "flood fill", "select (HTML tag)", "PixelEditor class", dispatch}}

_Tools_ are things like drawing pixels or filling in an area. The
application shows the set of available tools as a `<select>` field.
The currently selected tool determines what happens when the user
interacts with the picture with a pointer device. The set of
available tools is provided as
an object that maps the names that appear in the drop-down field to
functions that implement the tools. Such functions get a picture
position, a current application state, and a `dispatch` function as
arguments. They may return a move handler function that gets called
with a new position and a current state when the pointer moves to a
different pixel.

```{includeCode: true}
class PixelEditor {
  constructor(state, config) {
    let {tools, controls, dispatch} = config;
    this.state = state;

    this.canvas = new PictureCanvas(state.picture, pos => {
      let tool = tools[this.state.tool];
      let onMove = tool(pos, this.state, dispatch);
      if (onMove) return pos => onMove(pos, this.state);
    });
    this.controls = controls.map(
      Control => new Control(state, config));
    this.dom = elt("div", {}, this.canvas.dom, elt("br"),
                   ...this.controls.reduce(
                     (a, c) => a.concat(" ", c.dom), []));
  }
  syncState(state) {
    this.state = state;
    this.canvas.syncState(state.picture);
    for (let ctrl of this.controls) ctrl.syncState(state);
  }
}
```

The pointer handler given to `PictureCanvas` calls the currently
selected tool with the appropriate arguments and, if that returns a
move handler, adapts it to also receive the state.

{{index "reduce method", "map method", whitespace, "syncState method"}}

All controls are constructed and stored in `this.controls` so that
they can be updated when the application state changes. The call to
`reduce` introduces spaces between the controls' DOM elements. That
way they don't look so pressed together.

{{index "select (HTML tag)", "change event", "ToolSelect class", "syncState method"}}

The first control is the ((tool)) selection menu. It creates a
`<select>` element with an option for each tool and sets up a
`"change"` event handler that updates the application state when the
user selects a different tool.

```{includeCode: true}
class ToolSelect {
  constructor(state, {tools, dispatch}) {
    this.select = elt("select", {
      onchange: () => dispatch({tool: this.select.value})
    }, ...Object.keys(tools).map(name => elt("option", {
      selected: name == state.tool
    }, name)));
    this.dom = elt("label", null, "🖌 Tool: ", this.select);
  }
  syncState(state) { this.select.value = state.tool; }
}
```

{{index "label (HTML tag)"}}

By wrapping the label text and the field in a `<label>` element, we
tell the browser that the label belongs to that field so that you
can, for example, click the label to focus the field.

{{index "color field", "input (HTML tag)"}}

We also need to be able to change the color, so let's add a control for
that. An HTML `<input>` element with a `type` attribute of `color`
gives us a form field that is specialized for selecting colors. Such a
field's value is always a CSS color code in `"#RRGGBB"` format (red,
green, and blue components, two digits per color). The browser will
show a ((color picker)) interface when the user interacts with it.

{{if book

Depending on the browser, the color picker might look like this:

{{figure {url: "img/color-field.png", alt: "A color field", width: "6cm"}}}

if}}

{{index "ColorSelect class", "syncState method"}}

This ((control)) creates such a field and wires it up to stay
synchronized with the application state's `color` property.

```{includeCode: true}
class ColorSelect {
  constructor(state, {dispatch}) {
    this.input = elt("input", {
      type: "color",
      value: state.color,
      onchange: () => dispatch({color: this.input.value})
    });
    this.dom = elt("label", null, "🎨 Color: ", this.input);
  }
  syncState(state) { this.input.value = state.color; }
}
```

## Drawing tools

Before we can draw anything, we need to implement the ((tool))s that
will control the functionality of mouse or touch events on the canvas.

{{index "draw function"}}

The most basic tool is the draw tool, which changes any ((pixel)) you
click or tap to the currently selected color. It dispatches an action
that updates the picture to a version in which the pointed-at pixel is
given the currently selected color.

```{includeCode: true}
function draw(pos, state, dispatch) {
  function drawPixel({x, y}, state) {
    let drawn = {x, y, color: state.color};
    dispatch({picture: state.picture.draw([drawn])});
  }
  drawPixel(pos, state);
  return drawPixel;
}
```

The function immediately calls the `drawPixel` function but then also
returns it so that it is called again for newly touched pixels when
the user drags or ((swipe))s over the picture.

{{index "rectangle function"}}

To draw larger shapes, it can be useful to quickly create
((rectangle))s. The `rectangle` ((tool)) draws a rectangle between the
point where you start ((dragging)) and the point that you drag to.

```{includeCode: true}
function rectangle(start, state, dispatch) {
  function drawRectangle(pos) {
    let xStart = Math.min(start.x, pos.x);
    let yStart = Math.min(start.y, pos.y);
    let xEnd = Math.max(start.x, pos.x);
    let yEnd = Math.max(start.y, pos.y);
    let drawn = [];
    for (let y = yStart; y <= yEnd; y++) {
      for (let x = xStart; x <= xEnd; x++) {
        drawn.push({x, y, color: state.color});
      }
    }
    dispatch({picture: state.picture.draw(drawn)});
  }
  drawRectangle(start);
  return drawRectangle;
}
```

{{index "persistent data structure"}}

An important detail in this implementation is that when dragging, the
rectangle is redrawn on the picture from the _original_ ((state)).
That way, you can make the rectangle larger and smaller again while
creating it, without the intermediate rectangles sticking around in
the final picture. This is one of the reasons why ((immutable))
picture objects are useful—we'll see another reason later.

Implementing ((flood fill)) is somewhat more involved. This is a
((tool)) that fills the pixel under the pointer and all adjacent
pixels that have the same color. "Adjacent" means directly
horizontally or vertically adjacent, not diagonally. This picture
illustrates the set of ((pixel))s colored when the flood fill tool is
used at the marked pixel:

{{figure {url: "img/flood-grid.svg", alt: "A pixel grid showing the area filled by a flood fill operation", width: "6cm"}}}

{{index "fill function"}}

Interestingly, the way we'll do this looks a bit like the
((pathfinding)) code from [Chapter ?](robot). Whereas that code
searched through a graph to find a route, this code searches through a
grid to find all "connected" pixels. The problem of keeping track of a
branching set of possible routes is similar.

```{includeCode: true}
const around = [{dx: -1, dy: 0}, {dx: 1, dy: 0},
                {dx: 0, dy: -1}, {dx: 0, dy: 1}];

function fill({x, y}, state, dispatch) {
  let targetColor = state.picture.pixel(x, y);
  let drawn = [{x, y, color: state.color}];
  for (let done = 0; done < drawn.length; done++) {
    for (let {dx, dy} of around) {
      let x = drawn[done].x + dx, y = drawn[done].y + dy;
      if (x >= 0 && x < state.picture.width &&
          y >= 0 && y < state.picture.height &&
          state.picture.pixel(x, y) == targetColor &&
          !drawn.some(p => p.x == x && p.y == y)) {
        drawn.push({x, y, color: state.color});
      }
    }
  }
  dispatch({picture: state.picture.draw(drawn)});
}
```

The ((array)) of drawn pixels doubles as the function's ((work list)).
For each pixel reached, we have to see whether any adjacent pixels have the
same color and haven't already been painted over. The loop counter
lags behind the length of the `drawn` array as new pixels are added.
Any pixels ahead of it still need to be explored. When it catches up
with the length, no unexplored pixels remain, and the function is
done.

{{index "pick function"}}

The final ((tool)) is a ((color picker)), which allows you to point at
a color in the picture to use it as the current drawing color.

```{includeCode: true}
function pick(pos, state, dispatch) {
  dispatch({color: state.picture.pixel(pos.x, pos.y)});
}
```

{{if interactive

We can now test our application!

```{lang: "text/html"}
<div></div>
<script>
  let state = {
    tool: "draw",
    color: "#000000",
    picture: Picture.empty(60, 30, "#f0f0f0")
  };
  let app = new PixelEditor(state, {
    tools: {draw, fill, rectangle, pick},
    controls: [ToolSelect, ColorSelect],
    dispatch(action) {
      state = updateState(state, action);
      app.syncState(state);
    }
  });
  document.querySelector("div").appendChild(app.dom);
</script>
```

if}}

## Saving and loading

{{index "SaveButton class", "drawPicture function"}}

When we've drawn our masterpiece, we'll want to save it for later. We
should add a button for ((download))ing the current picture as an
image ((file)). This ((control)) provides that button:

```{includeCode: true}
class SaveButton {
  constructor(state) {
    this.picture = state.picture;
    this.dom = elt("button", {
      onclick: () => this.save()
    }, "💾 Save");
  }
  save() {
    let canvas = elt("canvas");
    drawPicture(this.picture, canvas, 1);
    let link = elt("a", {
      href: canvas.toDataURL(),
      download: "pixelart.png"
    });
    document.body.appendChild(link);
    link.click();
    link.remove();
  }
  syncState(state) { this.picture = state.picture; }
}
```

{{index "canvas (HTML tag)"}}

The component keeps track of the current picture so that it can access
it when saving. To create the image file, it uses a `<canvas>` element
that it draws the picture on (at a scale of one pixel per pixel).

{{index "toDataURL method", "data URL"}}

The `toDataURL` method on a canvas element creates a URL that starts
with `data:`. Unlike `http:` and `https:` URLs, data URLs contain the
whole resource in the URL. They are usually very long, but they
allow us to create working links to arbitrary pictures, right here in
the browser.

{{index "a (HTML tag)", "download attribute"}}

To actually get the browser to download the picture, we then create a
((link)) element that points at this URL and has a `download`
attribute. Such links, when clicked, make the browser show a file save
dialog. We add that link to the document, simulate a click on it, and
remove it again.

You can do a lot with ((browser)) technology, but sometimes the way to
do it is rather odd.

{{index "LoadButton class", control}}

And it gets worse. We'll also want to be able to load existing image
((file))s into our application. To do that, we again define a button
component.

```{includeCode: true}
class LoadButton {
  constructor(_, {dispatch}) {
    this.dom = elt("button", {
      onclick: () => startLoad(dispatch)
    }, "📁 Load");
  }
  syncState() {}
}

function startLoad(dispatch) {
  let input = elt("input", {
    type: "file",
    onchange: () => finishLoad(input.files[0], dispatch)
  });
  document.body.appendChild(input);
  input.click();
  input.remove();
}
```

{{index "file file", "input (HTML tag)"}}

To get access to a file on the user's computer, we need the user to
select the file through a file input field. But I don't want the load
button to look like a file input field, so we create the file input
when the button is clicked and then pretend that it itself was
clicked.

{{index "FileReader class", "img (HTML tag)", "readAsDataURL method", "Picture class"}}

When the user has selected a file, we can use `FileReader` to get
access to its contents, again as a ((data URL)). That URL can be used
to create an `<img>` element, but because we can't get direct access
to the pixels in such an image, we can't create a `Picture` object
from that.

```{includeCode: true}
function finishLoad(file, dispatch) {
  if (file == null) return;
  let reader = new FileReader();
  reader.addEventListener("load", () => {
    let image = elt("img", {
      onload: () => dispatch({
        picture: pictureFromImage(image)
      }),
      src: reader.result
    });
  });
  reader.readAsDataURL(file);
}
```

{{index "canvas (HTML tag)", "getImageData method", "pictureFromImage function"}}

To get access to the pixels, we must first draw the picture to a
`<canvas>` element. The canvas context has a `getImageData` method
that allows a script to read its ((pixel))s. So, once the picture is on
the canvas, we can access it and construct a `Picture` object.

```{includeCode: true}
function pictureFromImage(image) {
  let width = Math.min(100, image.width);
  let height = Math.min(100, image.height);
  let canvas = elt("canvas", {width, height});
  let cx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  cx.drawImage(image, 0, 0);
  let pixels = [];
  let {data} = cx.getImageData(0, 0, width, height);

  function hex(n) {
    return n.toString(16).padStart(2, "0");
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
    let [r, g, b] = data.slice(i, i + 3);
    pixels.push("#" + hex(r) + hex(g) + hex(b));
  }
  return new Picture(width, height, pixels);
}
```

We'll limit the size of images to 100 by 100 pixels since anything
bigger will look _huge_ on our display and might slow down the
interface.

{{index "getImageData method", color, transparency}}

The `data` property of the object returned by `getImageData` is an
array of color components. For each pixel in the rectangle specified
by the arguments, it contains four values, which represent the red,
green, blue, and _((alpha))_ components of the pixel's color, as
numbers between 0 and 255. The alpha part represents opacity—when it
is zero, the pixel is fully transparent, and when it is 255, it is
fully opaque. For our purpose, we can ignore it.

{{index "hexadecimal number", "toString method"}}

The two hexadecimal digits per component, as used in our color
notation, correspond precisely to the 0 to 255 range—two base-16
digits can express 16^2^ = 256 different numbers. The `toString`
method of numbers can be given a base as argument, so `n.toString(16)`
will produce a string representation in base 16. We have to make sure
that each number takes up two digits, so the `hex` helper function
calls `padStart` to add a leading zero when necessary.

We can load and save now! That leaves one more feature before we're
done.

## Undo history

Half of the process of editing is making little mistakes and
correcting them. So an important feature in a drawing
program is an ((undo history)).

{{index "persistent data structure"}}

To be able to undo changes, we need to store previous versions of the
picture. Since it's an ((immutable)) value, that is easy. But it does
require an additional field in the application ((state)).

{{index "done property"}}

We'll add a `done` array to keep previous versions of the ((picture)).
Maintaining this property requires a more complicated state update
function that adds pictures to the array.

{{index "doneAt property", "historyUpdateState function", "Date.now function"}}

But we don't want to store _every_ change, only changes a certain
amount of ((time)) apart. To be able to do that, we'll need a second
property, `doneAt`, tracking the time at which we last stored a
picture in the history.

```{includeCode: true}
function historyUpdateState(state, action) {
  if (action.undo == true) {
    if (state.done.length == 0) return state;
    return Object.assign({}, state, {
      picture: state.done[0],
      done: state.done.slice(1),
      doneAt: 0
    });
  } else if (action.picture &&
             state.doneAt < Date.now() - 1000) {
    return Object.assign({}, state, action, {
      done: [state.picture, ...state.done],
      doneAt: Date.now()
    });
  } else {
    return Object.assign({}, state, action);
  }
}
```

{{index "undo history"}}

When the action is an undo action, the function takes the most recent
picture from the history and makes that the current picture. It sets
`doneAt` to zero so that the next change is guaranteed to store the
picture back in the history, allowing you to revert to it another
time if you want.

Otherwise, if the action contains a new picture and the last time we
stored something is more than a second (1000 milliseconds) ago, the
`done` and `doneAt` properties are updated to store the previous
picture.

{{index "UndoButton class", control}}

The undo button ((component)) doesn't do much. It dispatches undo
actions when clicked and disables itself when there is nothing to
undo.

```{includeCode: true}
class UndoButton {
  constructor(state, {dispatch}) {
    this.dom = elt("button", {
      onclick: () => dispatch({undo: true}),
      disabled: state.done.length == 0
    }, "⮪ Undo");
  }
  syncState(state) {
    this.dom.disabled = state.done.length == 0;
  }
}
```

## Let's draw

{{index "PixelEditor class", "startState constant", "baseTools constant", "baseControls constant", "startPixelEditor function"}}

To set up the application, we need to create a ((state)), a set of
((tool))s, a set of ((control))s, and a ((dispatch)) function. We can
pass them to the `PixelEditor` constructor to create the main
component. Since we'll need to create several editors in the
exercises, we first define some bindings.

```{includeCode: true}
const startState = {
  tool: "draw",
  color: "#000000",
  picture: Picture.empty(60, 30, "#f0f0f0"),
  done: [],
  doneAt: 0
};

const baseTools = {draw, fill, rectangle, pick};

const baseControls = [
  ToolSelect, ColorSelect, SaveButton, LoadButton, UndoButton
];

function startPixelEditor({state = startState,
                           tools = baseTools,
                           controls = baseControls}) {
  let app = new PixelEditor(state, {
    tools,
    controls,
    dispatch(action) {
      state = historyUpdateState(state, action);
      app.syncState(state);
    }
  });
  return app.dom;
}
```

{{index "destructuring binding", "= operator"}}

When destructuring an object or array, you can use `=` after a binding
name to give the binding a ((default)) value, which is used when the
((property)) is missing or holds `undefined`. The `startPixelEditor`
function makes use of this to accept an object with a number of
optional properties as an argument. If you don't provide a `tools`
property, for example, `tools` will be bound to `baseTools`.

This is how we get an actual editor on the screen:

```{lang: "text/html", startCode: true}
<div></div>
<script>
  document.querySelector("div")
    .appendChild(startPixelEditor({}));
</script>
```

{{if interactive

Go ahead and draw something. I'll wait.

if}}

## Why is this so hard?

Browser technology is amazing. It provides a powerful set of interface
building blocks, ways to style and manipulate them, and tools to
inspect and debug your applications. The software you write for the
((browser)) can be run on almost every computer and phone on the
planet.

At the same time, browser technology is ridiculous. You have to learn
a large number of silly tricks and obscure facts to master it, and the
default programming model it provides is so problematic that most
programmers prefer to cover it in several layers of ((abstraction))
rather than deal with it directly.

{{index standard, evolution}}

And though the situation is definitely improving, it mostly does so in
the form of more elements being added to address shortcomings—creating
even more ((complexity)). A feature used by a million websites can't
really be replaced. Even if it could, it would be hard to decide
what it should be replaced with.

{{index "social factors", "economic factors"}}

Technology never exists in a vacuum—we're constrained by our tools and
the social, economic, and ((historical factors)) that produced them.
This can be annoying, but it is generally more productive to try to
build a good understanding of how the _existing_ technical reality
works—and why it is the way it is—than to rage against it or hold out
for another reality.

New ((abstraction))s _can_ be helpful. The component model and ((data
flow)) convention I used in this chapter is a crude form of that. As
mentioned, there are libraries that try to make user interface
programming more pleasant. At the time of writing,
[React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) are
popular choices, but there's a whole cottage industry of such
frameworks. If you're interested in programming web applications, I
recommend investigating a few of them to understand how they work and
what benefits they provide.

## Exercises

There is still room for improvement in our program. Let's add a few
more features as exercises.

### Keyboard bindings

{{index "keyboard bindings (exercise)"}}

Add ((keyboard)) shortcuts to the application. The first letter of a
tool's name selects the tool, and [control]{keyname}-Z or [command]{keyname}-Z activates undo.

{{index "PixelEditor class", "tabindex attribute", "elt function", "keydown event"}}

Do this by modifying the `PixelEditor` component. Add a `tabIndex`
property of 0 to the wrapping `<div>` element so that it can receive
keyboard ((focus)). Note that the _property_ corresponding to the
`tabindex` _attribute_ is called `tabIndex`, with a capital I, and our
`elt` function expects property names. Register the key event handlers
directly on that element. This means you have to click, touch, or
tab to the application before you can interact with it with the
keyboard.

{{index "ctrlKey property", "metaKey property", "control key", "command key"}}

Remember that keyboard events have `ctrlKey` and `metaKey` (for the
[command]{keyname} key on Mac) properties that you can use to see whether those
keys are held down.

{{if interactive

```{test: no, lang: "text/html"}
<div></div>
<script>
  // The original PixelEditor class. Extend the constructor.
  class PixelEditor {
    constructor(state, config) {
      let {tools, controls, dispatch} = config;
      this.state = state;

      this.canvas = new PictureCanvas(state.picture, pos => {
        let tool = tools[this.state.tool];
        let onMove = tool(pos, this.state, dispatch);
        if (onMove) {
          return pos => onMove(pos, this.state, dispatch);
        }
      });
      this.controls = controls.map(
        Control => new Control(state, config));
      this.dom = elt("div", {}, this.canvas.dom, elt("br"),
                     ...this.controls.reduce(
                       (a, c) => a.concat(" ", c.dom), []));
    }
    syncState(state) {
      this.state = state;
      this.canvas.syncState(state.picture);
      for (let ctrl of this.controls) ctrl.syncState(state);
    }
  }

  document.querySelector("div")
    .appendChild(startPixelEditor({}));
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "keyboard bindings (exercise)", "key property", "shift key"}}

The `key` property of events for letter keys will be the lowercase
letter itself, if [shift]{keyname} isn't being held. We're not interested in
key events with [shift]{keyname} here.

{{index "keydown event"}}

A `"keydown"` handler can inspect its event object to see whether it
matches any of the shortcuts. You can automatically get the list of
first letters from the `tools` object so that you don't have to write
them out.

{{index "preventDefault method"}}

When the key event matches a shortcut, call `preventDefault` on it and
((dispatch)) the appropriate action.

hint}}

### Efficient drawing

{{index "efficient drawing (exercise)", "canvas (HTML tag)", efficiency}}

During drawing, the majority of work that our application does happens
in `drawPicture`. Creating a new state and updating the rest of the
DOM isn't very expensive, but repainting all the pixels on the canvas
is quite a bit of work.

{{index "syncState method", "PictureCanvas class"}}

Find a way to make the `syncState` method of `PictureCanvas` faster by
redrawing only the pixels that actually changed.

{{index "drawPicture function", compatibility}}

Remember that `drawPicture` is also used by the save button, so if you
change it, either make sure the changes don't break the old use or
create a new version with a different name.

{{index "width property", "height property"}}

Also note that changing the size of a `<canvas>` element, by setting
its `width` or `height` properties, clears it, making it entirely
transparent again.

{{if interactive

```{test: no, lang: "text/html"}
<div></div>
<script>
  // Change this method
  PictureCanvas.prototype.syncState = function(picture) {
    if (this.picture == picture) return;
    this.picture = picture;
    drawPicture(this.picture, this.dom, scale);
  };

  // You may want to use or change this as well
  function drawPicture(picture, canvas, scale) {
    canvas.width = picture.width * scale;
    canvas.height = picture.height * scale;
    let cx = canvas.getContext("2d");

    for (let y = 0; y < picture.height; y++) {
      for (let x = 0; x < picture.width; x++) {
        cx.fillStyle = picture.pixel(x, y);
        cx.fillRect(x * scale, y * scale, scale, scale);
      }
    }
  }

  document.querySelector("div")
    .appendChild(startPixelEditor({}));
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "efficient drawing (exercise)"}}

This exercise is a good example of how ((immutable)) data structures
can make code _faster_. Because we have both the old and the new
picture, we can compare them and redraw only the pixels that changed
color, saving more than 99 percent of the drawing work in most cases.

{{index "drawPicture function"}}

You can either write a new function `updatePicture` or have
`drawPicture` take an extra argument, which may be undefined or the
previous picture. For each ((pixel)), the function checks whether a
previous picture was passed with the same color at this position and
skips the pixel when that is the case.

{{index "width property", "height property", "canvas (HTML tag)"}}

Because the canvas gets cleared when we change its size, you should
also avoid touching its `width` and `height` properties when the old
picture and the new picture have the same size. If they are different, which
will happen when a new picture has been loaded, you can set
the binding holding the old picture to null after changing the canvas size because you shouldn't
skip any pixels after you've changed the canvas size.

hint}}

### Circles

{{index "circles (exercise)", dragging}}

Define a ((tool)) called `circle` that draws a filled circle when you
drag. The center of the circle lies at the point where the drag or
touch gesture starts, and its ((radius)) is determined by the distance
dragged.

{{if interactive

```{test: no, lang: "text/html"}
<div></div>
<script>
  function circle(pos, state, dispatch) {
    // Your code here
  }

  let dom = startPixelEditor({
    tools: Object.assign({}, baseTools, {circle})
  });
  document.querySelector("div").appendChild(dom);
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "circles (exercise)", "rectangle function"}}

You can take some inspiration from the `rectangle` tool. Like that
tool, you'll want to keep drawing on the _starting_ picture, rather
than the current picture, when the pointer moves.

To figure out which pixels to color, you can use the ((Pythagorean
theorem)). First figure out the distance between the current pointer
position and the start position by taking the square root
(`Math.sqrt`) of the sum of the square (`Math.pow(x, 2)`) of the difference in
x-coordinates and the square of the difference in y-coordinates. Then
loop over a square of pixels around the start position, whose sides
are at least twice the ((radius)), and color those that are within the
circle's radius, again using the Pythagorean formula to figure out
their ((distance)) from the center.

Make sure you don't try to color pixels that are outside of the
picture's boundaries.

hint}}

### Proper lines

{{index "proper lines (exercise)", "line drawing"}}

This is a more advanced exercise than the preceding two, and it will
require you to design a solution to a nontrivial problem. Make sure
you have plenty of time and ((patience)) before starting to work on
this exercise, and do not get discouraged by initial failures.

{{index "draw function", "mousemove event", "touchmove event"}}

On most browsers, when you select the `draw` ((tool)) and quickly drag
across the picture, you don't get a closed line. Rather, you get dots
with gaps between them because the `"mousemove"` or `"touchmove"`
events did not fire quickly enough to hit every ((pixel)).

Improve the `draw` tool to make it draw a full line. This means you
have to make the motion handler function remember the previous
position and connect that to the current one.

To do this, since the pixels can be an arbitrary distance apart,
you'll have to write a general line drawing function.

A line between two pixels is a connected chain of pixels, as straight
as possible, going from the start to the end. Diagonally adjacent
pixels count as a connected. So a slanted line should look like the
picture on the left, not the picture on the right.

{{figure {url: "img/line-grid.svg", alt: "Two pixelated lines, one light, skipping across pixels diagonally, and one heavy, with all pixels connected horizontally or vertically", width: "6cm"}}}

If we have code that draws a line between two arbitrary points, we
might as well use it to also define a `line` tool,
which draws a straight line between the start and end of a drag.

{{if interactive

```{test: no, lang: "text/html"}
<div></div>
<script>
  // The old draw tool. Rewrite this.
  function draw(pos, state, dispatch) {
    function drawPixel({x, y}, state) {
      let drawn = {x, y, color: state.color};
      dispatch({picture: state.picture.draw([drawn])});
    }
    drawPixel(pos, state);
    return drawPixel;
  }

  function line(pos, state, dispatch) {
    // Your code here
  }

  let dom = startPixelEditor({
    tools: {draw, line, fill, rectangle, pick}
  });
  document.querySelector("div").appendChild(dom);
</script>
```

if}}

{{hint

{{index "proper lines (exercise)", "line drawing"}}

The thing about the problem of drawing a pixelated line is that it is
really four similar but slightly different problems. Drawing a
horizontal line from the left to the right is easy—you loop over the
x-coordinates and color a pixel at every step. If the line has a
slight slope (less than 45 degrees or ¼π radians), you can interpolate
the y-coordinate along the slope. You still need one pixel per _x_
position, with the _y_ position of those pixels determined by the
slope.

But as soon as your slope goes across 45 degrees, you need to switch
the way you treat the coordinates. You now need one pixel per _y_
position since the line goes up more than it goes left. And then,
when you cross 135 degrees, you have to go back to looping over the
x-coordinates, but from right to left.

You don't actually have to write four loops. Since drawing a line from
_A_ to _B_ is the same as drawing a line from _B_ to _A_, you can swap
the start and end positions for lines going from right to left and
treat them as going left to right.

So you need two different loops. The first thing your line drawing
function should do is check whether the difference between the
x-coordinates is larger than the difference between the y-coordinates.
If it is, this is a horizontal-ish line, and if not, a vertical-ish
one.

{{index "Math.abs function", "absolute value"}}

Make sure you compare the _absolute_ values of the _x_ and _y_
difference, which you can get with `Math.abs`.

{{index "swapping bindings"}}

Once you know along which ((axis)) you will be looping, you can check
whether the start point has a higher coordinate along that axis than
the endpoint and swap them if necessary. A succinct way to swap the
values of two bindings in JavaScript uses ((destructuring assignment))
like this:

```{test: no}
[start, end] = [end, start];
```

{{index rounding}}

Then you can compute the ((slope)) of the line, which determines the
amount the coordinate on the other axis changes for each step you
take along your main axis. With that, you can run a loop along the
main axis while also tracking the corresponding position on the other
axis, and you can draw pixels on every iteration. Make sure you round the
non-main axis coordinates since they are likely to be fractional and
the `draw` method doesn't respond well to fractional coordinates.

hint}}
