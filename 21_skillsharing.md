{{index "skill-sharing project", meetup, "project chapter"}}

{{figure {url: "img/chapter_picture_21.jpg", alt: "Picture of two unicycles", chapter: "framed"}}}

A _((skill-sharing))_ meeting is an event where people with a shared
interest come together and give small, informal presentations about
things they know. At a ((gardening)) skill-sharing meeting, someone
might explain how to cultivate ((celery)). Or in a programming
skill-sharing group, you could drop by and tell people about Node.js.

{{index learning, "users' group"}}

Such meetups—also often called _users' groups_ when they are about
computers—are a great way to broaden your horizon, learn about new
developments, or simply meet people with similar interests. Many
larger cities have JavaScript meetups. They are typically free to
attend, and I've found the ones I've visited to be friendly and
welcoming.

In this final project chapter, our goal is to set up a ((website)) for
managing ((talk))s given at a skill-sharing meeting. Imagine a small
group of people meeting up regularly in the office of one of the
members to talk about ((unicycling)). The previous organizer of the
meetings moved to another town, and nobody stepped forward to take
over this task. We want a system that will let the participants
propose and discuss talks among themselves, without a central
organizer.

[Just like in the [previous chapter](node), some of the code in this
chapter is written for Node.js, and running it directly in the HTML
page that you are looking at is unlikely to work.]{if interactive} The
full code for the project can be ((download))ed from
[_https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/skillsharing.zip_](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/skillsharing.zip).

## Design

{{index "skill-sharing project", persistence}}

There is a _((server))_ part to this project, written for ((Node.js)),
and a _((client))_ part, written for the ((browser)). The server
stores the system's data and provides it to the client. It also serves
the files that implement the client-side system.

The server keeps the list of ((talk))s proposed for the next meeting,
and the client shows this list. Each talk has a presenter name, a
title, a summary, and an array of ((comment))s associated with it. The
client allows users to propose new talks (adding them to the list),
delete talks, and comment on existing talks. Whenever the user makes
such a change, the client makes an ((HTTP)) ((request)) to tell the
server about it.

{{figure {url: "img/skillsharing.png", alt: "Screenshot of the skill-sharing website",width: "10cm"}}}

{{index "live view", "user experience", "pushing data", connection}}

The ((application)) will be set up to show a _live_ view of the
current proposed talks and their comments. Whenever someone,
somewhere, submits a new talk or adds a comment, all people who have
the page open in their browsers should immediately see the change.
This poses a bit of a challenge—there is no way for a web server to
open a connection to a client, nor is there a good way to know which
clients are currently looking at a given website.

{{index "Node.js"}}

A common solution to this problem is called _((long polling))_, which
happens to be one of the motivations for Node's design.

## Long polling

{{index firewall, notification, "long polling", network}}

To be able to immediately notify a client that something changed, we
need a ((connection)) to that client. Since web ((browser))s do not
traditionally accept connections and clients are often behind
((router))s that would block such connections anyway, having the
server initiate this connection is not practical.

We can arrange for the client to open the connection and keep it
around so that the server can use it to send information when it needs
to do so.

{{index socket}}

But an ((HTTP)) request allows only a simple flow of information: the
client sends a request, the server comes back with a single response,
and that is it. There is a technology called _((WebSockets))_,
supported by modern browsers, that makes it possible to open
((connection))s for arbitrary data exchange. But using them properly
is somewhat tricky.

In this chapter, we use a simpler technique—((long polling))—where
clients continuously ask the server for new information using regular
HTTP requests, and the server stalls its answer when it has nothing
new to report.

{{index "live view"}}

As long as the client makes sure it constantly has a polling request
open, it will receive information from the server quickly after it
becomes available. For example, if Fatma has our skill-sharing
application open in her browser, that browser will have made a request
for updates and will be waiting for a response to that request. When Iman
submits a talk on Extreme Downhill Unicycling, the server will notice
that Fatma is waiting for updates and send a response containing the
new talk to her pending request. Fatma's browser will receive the data
and update the screen to show the talk.

{{index robustness, timeout}}

To prevent connections from timing out (being aborted because of a
lack of activity), ((long polling)) techniques usually set a maximum
time for each request, after which the server will respond anyway,
even though it has nothing to report, after which the client will
start a new request. Periodically restarting the request also makes
the technique more robust, allowing clients to recover from temporary
((connection)) failures or server problems.

{{index "Node.js"}}

A busy server that is using long polling may have thousands of waiting
requests, and thus ((TCP)) connections, open. Node, which makes it
easy to manage many connections without creating a separate thread of
control for each one, is a good fit for such a system.

## HTTP interface

{{index "skill-sharing project"}}

Before we start designing either the server or the client, let's think
about the point where they touch: the ((HTTP)) ((interface)) over
which they communicate.

{{index [path, URL]}}

We will use ((JSON)) as the format of our request and response body.
Like in the file server from [Chapter ?](node#file_server), we'll try
to make good use of HTTP ((method))s and ((header))s. The interface is
centered around the `/talks` path. Paths that do not start with
`/talks` will be used for serving ((static file))s—the HTML and
JavaScript code for the client-side system.

{{index "GET method"}}

A `GET` request to `/talks` returns a JSON document like this:

```{lang: "application/json"}
[{"title": "Unituning",
  "presenter": "Jamal",
  "summary": "Modifying your cycle for extra style",
  "comments": []}]}
```

{{index "PUT method", URL}}

Creating a new talk is done by making a `PUT` request to a URL like
`/talks/Unituning`, where the part after the second slash is the title
of the talk. The `PUT` request's body should contain a ((JSON)) object
that has `presenter` and `summary` properties.

{{index "encodeURIComponent function", [escaping, "in URLs"], whitespace}}

Since talk titles may contain spaces and other characters that may not
appear normally in a URL, title strings must be encoded with the
`encodeURIComponent` function when building up such a URL.

```
console.log("/talks/" + encodeURIComponent("How to Idle"));
// → /talks/How%20to%20Idle
```

A request to create a talk about idling might look something like
this:

```{lang: http}
PUT /talks/How%20to%20Idle HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 92

{"presenter": "Maureen",
 "summary": "Standing still on a unicycle"}
```

Such URLs also support `GET` requests to retrieve the JSON
representation of a talk and `DELETE` requests to delete a talk.

{{index "POST method"}}

Adding a ((comment)) to a talk is done with a `POST` request to a URL
like `/talks/Unituning/comments`, with a JSON body that has `author`
and `message` properties.

```{lang: http}
POST /talks/Unituning/comments HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 72

{"author": "Iman",
 "message": "Will you talk about raising a cycle?"}
```

{{index "query string", timeout, "ETag header", "If-None-Match header"}}

To support ((long polling)), `GET` requests to `/talks` may include
extra headers that inform the server to delay the response if no new
information is available. We'll use a pair of headers normally
intended to manage caching: `ETag` and `If-None-Match`.

{{index "304 (HTTP status code)"}}

Servers may include an `ETag` ("entity tag") header in a response. Its
value is a string that identifies the current version of the resource.
Clients, when they later request that resource again, may make a
_((conditional request))_ by including an `If-None-Match` header whose
value holds that same string. If the resource hasn't changed, the
server will respond with status code 304, which means "not modified",
telling the client that its cached version is still current. When the
tag does not match, the server responds as normal.

{{index "Prefer header"}}

We need something like this, where the client can tell the server
which version of the list of talks it has, and the server
responds only when that list has changed. But instead of immediately
returning a 304 response, the server should stall the response and
return only when something new is available or a given amount of time
has elapsed. To distinguish long polling requests from normal
conditional requests, we give them another header, `Prefer: wait=90`,
which tells the server that the client is willing to wait up to 90
seconds for the response.

The server will keep a version number that it updates every time the
talks change and will use that as the `ETag` value. Clients can make
requests like this to be notified when the talks change:

```{lang: null}
GET /talks HTTP/1.1
If-None-Match: "4"
Prefer: wait=90

(time passes)

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
ETag: "5"
Content-Length: 295

[....]
```

{{index security}}

The protocol described here does not do any ((access control)).
Everybody can comment, modify talks, and even delete them. (Since the
Internet is full of ((hooligan))s, putting such a system online
without further protection probably wouldn't end well.)

## The server

{{index "skill-sharing project"}}

Let's start by building the ((server))-side part of the program. The
code in this section runs on ((Node.js)).

### Routing

{{index "createServer function", [path, URL]}}

Our server will use `createServer` to start an HTTP server. In the
function that handles a new request, we must distinguish between the
various kinds of requests (as determined by the ((method)) and the
path) that we support. This can be done with a long chain of `if`
statements, but there is a nicer way.

{{index dispatching}}

A _((router))_ is a component that helps dispatch a request to the
function that can handle it. You can tell the router, for example,
that `PUT` requests with a path that matches the regular expression
`/^\/talks\/([^\/]+)$/` (`/talks/` followed by a talk title) can be
handled by a given function. In addition, it can help extract the
meaningful parts of the path (in this case the talk title), wrapped in
parentheses in the ((regular expression)), and pass them to the
handler function.

There are a number of good router packages on ((NPM)), but here we'll
write one ourselves to illustrate the principle.

{{index "require function", "Router class", module}}

This is `router.js`, which we will later `require` from our server
module:

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/router.js"}
const {parse} = require("url");

module.exports = class Router {
  constructor() {
    this.routes = [];
  }
  add(method, url, handler) {
    this.routes.push({method, url, handler});
  }
  resolve(context, request) {
    let path = parse(request.url).pathname;

    for (let {method, url, handler} of this.routes) {
      let match = url.exec(path);
      if (!match || request.method != method) continue;
      let urlParts = match.slice(1).map(decodeURIComponent);
      return handler(context, ...urlParts, request);
    }
    return null;
  }
};
```

{{index "Router class"}}

The module exports the `Router` class. A router object allows new
handlers to be registered with the `add` method and can resolve
requests with its `resolve` method.

{{index "some method"}}

The latter will return a response when a handler was found, and `null`
otherwise. It tries the routes one at a time (in the order in which
they were defined) until a matching one is found.

{{index "capture group", "decodeURIComponent function", [escaping, "in URLs"]}}

The handler functions are called with the `context` value (which
will be the server instance in our case), match strings for any groups
they defined in their ((regular expression)), and the request object.
The strings have to be URL-decoded since the raw URL may contain
`%20`-style codes.

### Serving files

When a request matches none of the request types defined in our
router, the server must interpret it as a request for a file in the
`public` directory. It would be possible to use the file server
defined in [Chapter ?](node#file_server) to serve such files, but we
neither need nor want to support `PUT` and `DELETE` requests on files,
and we would like to have advanced features such as support for
caching. So let's use a solid, well-tested ((static file)) server from
((NPM)) instead.

{{index "createServer function", "ecstatic package"}}

I opted for `ecstatic`. This isn't the only such server on NPM, but it
works well and fits our purposes. The `ecstatic` package exports a
function that can be called with a configuration object to produce a
request handler function. We use the `root` option to tell the server
where it should look for files. The handler function accepts `request`
and `response` parameters and can be passed directly to `createServer`
to create a server that serves _only_ files. We want to first check
for requests that we should handle specially, though, so we wrap it in
another function.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
const {createServer} = require("http");
const Router = require("./router");
const ecstatic = require("ecstatic");

const router = new Router();
const defaultHeaders = {"Content-Type": "text/plain"};

class SkillShareServer {
  constructor(talks) {
    this.talks = talks;
    this.version = 0;
    this.waiting = [];

    let fileServer = ecstatic({root: "./public"});
    this.server = createServer((request, response) => {
      let resolved = router.resolve(this, request);
      if (resolved) {
        resolved.catch(error => {
          if (error.status != null) return error;
          return {body: String(error), status: 500};
        }).then(({body,
                  status = 200,
                  headers = defaultHeaders}) => {
          response.writeHead(status, headers);
          response.end(body);
        });
      } else {
        fileServer(request, response);
      }
    });
  }
  start(port) {
    this.server.listen(port);
  }
  stop() {
    this.server.close();
  }
}
```

This uses a similar convention as the file server from the [previous
chapter](node) for responses—handlers return promises that resolve to
objects describing the response. It wraps the server in an object that
also holds its state.

### Talks as resources

The ((talk))s that have been proposed are stored in the `talks`
property of the server, an object whose property names are the talk
titles. These will be exposed as HTTP ((resource))s under
`/talks/[title]`, so we need to add handlers to our router that
implement the various methods that clients can use to work with them.

{{index "GET method", "404 (HTTP status code)"}}

The handler for requests that `GET` a single talk must look up the
talk and respond either with the talk's JSON data or with a 404 error
response.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
const talkPath = /^\/talks\/([^\/]+)$/;

router.add("GET", talkPath, async (server, title) => {
  if (title in server.talks) {
    return {body: JSON.stringify(server.talks[title]),
            headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"}};
  } else {
    return {status: 404, body: `No talk '${title}' found`};
  }
});
```

{{index "DELETE method"}}

Deleting a talk is done by removing it from the `talks` object.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
router.add("DELETE", talkPath, async (server, title) => {
  if (title in server.talks) {
    delete server.talks[title];
    server.updated();
  }
  return {status: 204};
});
```

{{index "long polling", "updated method"}}

The `updated` method, which we will define
[later](skillsharing#updated), notifies waiting long polling requests
about the change.

{{index "readStream function", "body (HTTP)", stream}}

To retrieve the content of a request body, we define a function called
`readStream`, which reads all content from a ((readable stream)) and
returns a promise that resolves to a string.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
function readStream(stream) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let data = "";
    stream.on("error", reject);
    stream.on("data", chunk => data += chunk.toString());
    stream.on("end", () => resolve(data));
  });
}
```

{{index validation, input, "PUT method"}}

One handler that needs to read request bodies is the `PUT` handler,
which is used to create new ((talk))s. It has to check whether the
data it was given has `presenter` and `summary` properties, which are
strings. Any data coming from outside the system might be nonsense,
and we don't want to corrupt our internal data model or ((crash)) when
bad requests come in.

{{index "updated method"}}

If the data looks valid, the handler stores an object that represents
the new talk in the `talks` object, possibly ((overwriting)) an
existing talk with this title, and again calls `updated`.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
router.add("PUT", talkPath,
           async (server, title, request) => {
  let requestBody = await readStream(request);
  let talk;
  try { talk = JSON.parse(requestBody); }
  catch (_) { return {status: 400, body: "Invalid JSON"}; }

  if (!talk ||
      typeof talk.presenter != "string" ||
      typeof talk.summary != "string") {
    return {status: 400, body: "Bad talk data"};
  }
  server.talks[title] = {title,
                         presenter: talk.presenter,
                         summary: talk.summary,
                         comments: []};
  server.updated();
  return {status: 204};
});
```

{{index validation, "readStream function"}}

Adding a ((comment)) to a ((talk)) works similarly. We use
`readStream` to get the content of the request, validate the resulting
data, and store it as a comment when it looks valid.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
router.add("POST", /^\/talks\/([^\/]+)\/comments$/,
           async (server, title, request) => {
  let requestBody = await readStream(request);
  let comment;
  try { comment = JSON.parse(requestBody); }
  catch (_) { return {status: 400, body: "Invalid JSON"}; }

  if (!comment ||
      typeof comment.author != "string" ||
      typeof comment.message != "string") {
    return {status: 400, body: "Bad comment data"};
  } else if (title in server.talks) {
    server.talks[title].comments.push(comment);
    server.updated();
    return {status: 204};
  } else {
    return {status: 404, body: `No talk '${title}' found`};
  }
});
```

{{index "404 (HTTP status code)"}}

Trying to add a comment to a nonexistent talk returns a 404 error.

### Long polling support

The most interesting aspect of the server is the part that handles
((long polling)). When a `GET` request comes in for `/talks`, it may
be either a regular request or a long polling request.

{{index "talkResponse method", "ETag header"}}

There will be multiple places in which we have to send an array of
talks to the client, so we first define a helper method that builds up
such an array and includes an `ETag` header in the response.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
SkillShareServer.prototype.talkResponse = function() {
  let talks = [];
  for (let title of Object.keys(this.talks)) {
    talks.push(this.talks[title]);
  }
  return {
    body: JSON.stringify(talks),
    headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json",
              "ETag": `"${this.version}"`}
  };
};
```

{{index "query string", "url module", parsing}}

The handler itself needs to look at the request headers to see whether
`If-None-Match` and `Prefer` headers are present. Node stores headers,
whose names are specified to be case insensitive, under their
lowercase names.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
router.add("GET", /^\/talks$/, async (server, request) => {
  let tag = /"(.*)"/.exec(request.headers["if-none-match"]);
  let wait = /\bwait=(\d+)/.exec(request.headers["prefer"]);
  if (!tag || tag[1] != server.version) {
    return server.talkResponse();
  } else if (!wait) {
    return {status: 304};
  } else {
    return server.waitForChanges(Number(wait[1]));
  }
});
```

{{index "long polling", "waitForChanges method", "If-None-Match header", "Prefer header"}}

If no tag was given or a tag was given that doesn't match the
server's current version, the handler responds with the list of talks.
If the request is conditional and the talks did not change, we consult
the `Prefer` header to see whether we should delay the response or respond
right away.

{{index "304 (HTTP status code)", "setTimeout function", timeout, "callback function"}}

Callback functions for delayed requests are stored in the server's
`waiting` array so that they can be notified when something happens.
The `waitForChanges` method also immediately sets a timer to respond
with a 304 status when the request has waited long enough.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
SkillShareServer.prototype.waitForChanges = function(time) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    this.waiting.push(resolve);
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (!this.waiting.includes(resolve)) return;
      this.waiting = this.waiting.filter(r => r != resolve);
      resolve({status: 304});
    }, time * 1000);
  });
};
```

{{index "updated method"}}

{{id updated}}

Registering a change with `updated` increases the `version` property
and wakes up all waiting requests.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
SkillShareServer.prototype.updated = function() {
  this.version++;
  let response = this.talkResponse();
  this.waiting.forEach(resolve => resolve(response));
  this.waiting = [];
};
```

That concludes the server code. If we create an instance of
`SkillShareServer` and start it on port 8000, the resulting ((HTTP))
server serves files from the `public` subdirectory alongside a
talk-managing interface under the `/talks` URL.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/skillsharing_server.js"}
new SkillShareServer(Object.create(null)).start(8000);
```

## The client

{{index "skill-sharing project"}}

The ((client))-side part of the skill-sharing website consists of
three files: a tiny HTML page, a style sheet, and a JavaScript file.

### HTML

{{index "index.html"}}

It is a widely used convention for web servers to try to serve a file
named `index.html` when a request is made directly to a path that
corresponds to a directory. The ((file server)) module we use,
`ecstatic`, supports this convention. When a request is made to the
path `/`, the server looks for the file `./public/index.html`
(`./public` being the root we gave it) and returns that file if found.

Thus, if we want a page to show up when a browser is pointed at our
server, we should put it in `public/index.html`. This is our index
file:

```{lang: "text/html", includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/index.html"}
<!doctype html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Skill Sharing</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="skillsharing.css">

<h1>Skill Sharing</h1>

<script src="skillsharing_client.js"></script>
```

It defines the document ((title)) and includes a ((style sheet)),
which defines a few styles to, among other things, make sure there is
some space between talks.

At the bottom, it adds a heading at the top of the page and loads the
script that contains the ((client))-side application.

### Actions

The application state consists of the list of talks and the name of
the user, and we'll store it in a `{talks, user}` object. We don't
allow the user interface to directly manipulate the state or send off
HTTP requests. Rather, it may emit _actions_ that describe what the
user is trying to do.

{{index "handleAction function"}}

The `handleAction` function takes such an action and makes it happen.
Because our state updates are so simple, state changes are handled in
the same function.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
function handleAction(state, action) {
  if (action.type == "setUser") {
    localStorage.setItem("userName", action.user);
    return Object.assign({}, state, {user: action.user});
  } else if (action.type == "setTalks") {
    return Object.assign({}, state, {talks: action.talks});
  } else if (action.type == "newTalk") {
    fetchOK(talkURL(action.title), {
      method: "PUT",
      headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
      body: JSON.stringify({
        presenter: state.user,
        summary: action.summary
      })
    }).catch(reportError);
  } else if (action.type == "deleteTalk") {
    fetchOK(talkURL(action.talk), {method: "DELETE"})
      .catch(reportError);
  } else if (action.type == "newComment") {
    fetchOK(talkURL(action.talk) + "/comments", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
      body: JSON.stringify({
        author: state.user,
        message: action.message
      })
    }).catch(reportError);
  }
  return state;
}
```

{{index "localStorage object"}}

We'll store the user's name in `localStorage` so that it can be
restored when the page is loaded.

{{index "fetch function", "status property"}}

The actions that need to involve the server make network requests,
using `fetch`, to the HTTP interface described earlier. We use a
wrapper function, `fetchOK`, which makes sure the returned promise is
rejected when the server returns an error code.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
function fetchOK(url, options) {
  return fetch(url, options).then(response => {
    if (response.status < 400) return response;
    else throw new Error(response.statusText);
  });
}
```

{{index "talkURL function", "encodeURIComponent function"}}

This helper function is used to build up a ((URL)) for a talk
with a given title.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
function talkURL(title) {
  return "talks/" + encodeURIComponent(title);
}
```

{{index "error handling", "user experience", "reportError function"}}

When the request fails, we don't want to have our page just sit there,
doing nothing without explanation. So we define a function called
`reportError`, which at least shows the user a dialog that tells them
something went wrong.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
function reportError(error) {
  alert(String(error));
}
```

### Rendering components

{{index "renderUserField function"}}

We'll use an approach similar to the one we saw in [Chapter ?](paint),
splitting the application into components. But since some of the
components either never need to update or are always fully redrawn
when updated, we'll define those not as classes but as functions that
directly return a DOM node. For example, here is a component that
shows the field where the user can enter their name:

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
function renderUserField(name, dispatch) {
  return elt("label", {}, "Your name: ", elt("input", {
    type: "text",
    value: name,
    onchange(event) {
      dispatch({type: "setUser", user: event.target.value});
    }
  }));
}
```

{{index "elt function"}}

The `elt` function used to construct DOM elements is the one we used
in [Chapter ?](paint).

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no, hidden: true}
function elt(type, props, ...children) {
  let dom = document.createElement(type);
  if (props) Object.assign(dom, props);
  for (let child of children) {
    if (typeof child != "string") dom.appendChild(child);
    else dom.appendChild(document.createTextNode(child));
  }
  return dom;
}
```

{{index "renderTalk function"}}

A similar function is used to render talks, which include a list of
comments and a form for adding a new ((comment)).

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
function renderTalk(talk, dispatch) {
  return elt(
    "section", {className: "talk"},
    elt("h2", null, talk.title, " ", elt("button", {
      type: "button",
      onclick() {
        dispatch({type: "deleteTalk", talk: talk.title});
      }
    }, "Delete")),
    elt("div", null, "by ",
        elt("strong", null, talk.presenter)),
    elt("p", null, talk.summary),
    ...talk.comments.map(renderComment),
    elt("form", {
      onsubmit(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        let form = event.target;
        dispatch({type: "newComment",
                  talk: talk.title,
                  message: form.elements.comment.value});
        form.reset();
      }
    }, elt("input", {type: "text", name: "comment"}), " ",
       elt("button", {type: "submit"}, "Add comment")));
}
```

{{index "submit event"}}

The `"submit"` event handler calls `form.reset` to clear the form's
content after creating a `"newComment"` action.

When creating moderately complex pieces of DOM, this style of
programming starts to look rather messy. There's a widely used
(non-standard) JavaScript extension called _((JSX))_ that lets you
write HTML directly in your scripts, which can make such code prettier
(depending on what you consider pretty). Before you can actually run
such code, you have to run a program on your script to convert the
pseudo-HTML into JavaScript function calls much like the ones we use
here.

Comments are simpler to render.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
function renderComment(comment) {
  return elt("p", {className: "comment"},
             elt("strong", null, comment.author),
             ": ", comment.message);
}
```

{{index "form (HTML tag)", "renderTalkForm function"}}

Finally, the form that the user can use to create a new talk is
rendered like this:

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
function renderTalkForm(dispatch) {
  let title = elt("input", {type: "text"});
  let summary = elt("input", {type: "text"});
  return elt("form", {
    onsubmit(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      dispatch({type: "newTalk",
                title: title.value,
                summary: summary.value});
      event.target.reset();
    }
  }, elt("h3", null, "Submit a Talk"),
     elt("label", null, "Title: ", title),
     elt("label", null, "Summary: ", summary),
     elt("button", {type: "submit"}, "Submit"));
}
```

### Polling

{{index "pollTalks function", "long polling", "If-None-Match header", "Prefer header", "fetch function"}}

To start the app we need the current list of talks. Since the initial
load is closely related to the long polling process—the `ETag` from
the load must be used when polling—we'll write a function that keeps
polling the server for `/talks` and calls a ((callback function))
when a new set of talks is available.

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
async function pollTalks(update) {
  let tag = undefined;
  for (;;) {
    let response;
    try {
      response = await fetchOK("/talks", {
        headers: tag && {"If-None-Match": tag,
                         "Prefer": "wait=90"}
      });
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("Request failed: " + e);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
      continue;
    }
    if (response.status == 304) continue;
    tag = response.headers.get("ETag");
    update(await response.json());
  }
}
```

{{index "async function"}}

This is an `async` function so that looping and waiting for the
request is easier. It runs an infinite loop that, on each iteration,
retrieves the list of talks—either normally or, if this isn't the
first request, with the headers included that make it a long polling
request.

{{index "error handling", "Promise class", "setTimeout function"}}

When a request fails, the function waits a moment and then tries
again. This way, if your network connection goes away for a while and
then comes back, the application can recover and continue updating.
The promise resolved via `setTimeout` is a way to force the `async`
function to wait.

{{index "304 (HTTP status code)", "ETag header"}}

When the server gives back a 304 response, that means a long polling
request timed out, so the function should just immediately start the
next request. If the response is a normal 200 response, its body is
read as ((JSON)) and passed to the callback, and its `ETag` header
value is stored for the next iteration.

### The application

{{index "SkillShareApp class"}}

The following component ties the whole user interface together:

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
class SkillShareApp {
  constructor(state, dispatch) {
    this.dispatch = dispatch;
    this.talkDOM = elt("div", {className: "talks"});
    this.dom = elt("div", null,
                   renderUserField(state.user, dispatch),
                   this.talkDOM,
                   renderTalkForm(dispatch));
    this.syncState(state);
  }

  syncState(state) {
    if (state.talks != this.talks) {
      this.talkDOM.textContent = "";
      for (let talk of state.talks) {
        this.talkDOM.appendChild(
          renderTalk(talk, this.dispatch));
      }
      this.talks = state.talks;
    }
  }
}
```

{{index synchronization, "live view"}}

When the talks change, this component redraws all of them. This is
simple but also wasteful. We'll get back to that in the exercises.

We can start the application like this:

```{includeCode: ">code/skillsharing/public/skillsharing_client.js", test: no}
function runApp() {
  let user = localStorage.getItem("userName") || "Anon";
  let state, app;
  function dispatch(action) {
    state = handleAction(state, action);
    app.syncState(state);
  }

  pollTalks(talks => {
    if (!app) {
      state = {user, talks};
      app = new SkillShareApp(state, dispatch);
      document.body.appendChild(app.dom);
    } else {
      dispatch({type: "setTalks", talks});
    }
  }).catch(reportError);
}

runApp();
```

If you run the server and open two browser windows for
[_http://localhost:8000_](http://localhost:8000/) next to each other, you can
see that the actions you perform in one window are immediately visible
in the other.

## Exercises

{{index "Node.js", NPM}}

The following exercises will involve modifying the system defined in
this chapter. To work on them, make sure you ((download)) the code
first
([_https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/skillsharing.zip_](https://eloquentjavascript.net/code/skillsharing.zip)),
have Node installed [_https://nodejs.org_](https://nodejs.org), and have
installed the project's dependency with `npm install`.

### Disk persistence

{{index "data loss", persistence}}

The skill-sharing server keeps its data purely in ((memory)). This
means that when it ((crash))es or is restarted for any reason, all
talks and comments are lost.

{{index "hard drive"}}

Extend the server so that it stores the talk data to disk and
automatically reloads the data when it is restarted. Do not worry
about efficiency—do the simplest thing that works.

{{hint

{{index "file system", "writeFile function", "updated method", persistence}}

The simplest solution I can come up with is to encode the whole
`talks` object as ((JSON)) and dump it to a file with `writeFile`.
There is already a method (`updated`) that is called every time the
server's data changes. It can be extended to write the new data to
disk.

{{index "readFile function"}}

Pick a ((file))name, for example `./talks.json`. When the server
starts, it can try to read that file with `readFile`, and if that
succeeds, the server can use the file's contents as its starting data.

{{index prototype, "JSON.parse function"}}

Beware, though. The `talks` object started as a prototype-less object
so that the `in` operator could reliably be used. `JSON.parse` will
return regular objects with `Object.prototype` as their prototype. If
you use JSON as your file format, you'll have to copy the properties
of the object returned by `JSON.parse` into a new, prototype-less
object.

hint}}

### Comment field resets

{{index "comment field reset (exercise)", template, state}}

The wholesale redrawing of talks works pretty well because you usually
can't tell the difference between a DOM node and its identical
replacement. But there are exceptions. If you start typing something
in the comment ((field)) for a talk in one browser window and then, in
another, add a comment to that talk, the field in the first window
will be redrawn, removing both its content and its ((focus)).

In a heated discussion, where multiple people are adding comments at
the same time, this would be annoying. Can you come up with a way
to solve it?

{{hint

{{index "comment field reset (exercise)", template, "syncState method"}}

The best way to do this is probably to make talks component objects,
with a `syncState` method, so that they can be updated to show a
modified version of the talk. During normal operation, the only way a
talk can be changed is by adding more comments, so the `syncState`
method can be relatively simple.

The difficult part is that, when a changed list of talks comes in, we
have to reconcile the existing list of DOM components with the talks
on the new list—deleting components whose talk was deleted and
updating components whose talk changed.

{{index synchronization, "live view"}}

To do this, it might be helpful to keep a data structure that stores
the talk components under the talk titles so that you can easily
figure out whether a component exists for a given talk. You can then
loop over the new array of talks, and for each of them, either
synchronize an existing component or create a new one. To delete
components for deleted talks, you'll have to also loop over the
components and check whether the corresponding talks still exist.
